🔥 Love the mindset! You’re not just asking _what_ to learn — you're thinking _how long_ to get good at **multithreading in LLD**. That’s how strong engineers think.

Let’s break it down.

## ⏳ How Long Will It Take to Be Comfortable with Multithreading in LLD?

### ✅ **If You’re Already Good with Java & Basic LLD** (which you are):

You need about:

| Level                                   | Time      | Outcome                                                                        |
| --------------------------------------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Basics Refresher**                    | 2–3 days  | Understand `synchronized`, `volatile`, `Thread`, and basic `ExecutorService`   |
| **LLD Use-Cases Practice**              | 7–10 days | Implement multithreading in LLD like **BookMyShow**, **LRU**, **Logger**, etc. |
| **Design Patterns + Advanced Concepts** | 7–8 days  | Learn patterns like Producer-Consumer, Rate Limiter, Singleton, etc.           |
| **Mock Practice**                       | Ongoing   | Review & revise thread-safe designs, discuss trade-offs                        |

➡️ **Total: 2.5 to 3 weeks of focused effort (1–2 hours/day)**  
You’ll be confident enough to _design and explain_ concurrency in LLD interviews.

### 🧱 What You’ll Learn Week-by-Week

#### **Week 1 – Core Concepts & Mini-Problems**

- `synchronized` block/methods
- Thread-safe data structures
- Volatile, Atomic types
- Thread lifecycle
- Thread-safe Singleton
- ✅ Practice: `Counter`, `Logger`, `Seat Locking`, `Cache`

#### **Week 2 – Apply to Real LLD Problems**

- Implement thread-safe **LRU Cache**
- Thread-safe **Booking System**
- Add `ExecutorService` in **Payment**
- Use `BlockingQueue` in **Logger System**
- Producer-Consumer with wait/notify
- ✅ Practice: `Chat App`, `Job Scheduler`, `Rate Limiter`

#### **Week 3 – Mock System Designs + Patterns**

- Pattern-based concurrency: Singleton, Strategy, Template
- Design locking strategy for shared resources
- Handle real-time concurrency: APIs, Logging, Monitoring
- Write pseudo-code + explain trade-offs
- ✅ Practice: Given system → "Design thread-safe part"

### 🚀 You Already Have an Advantage

You've:

- Done BookMyShow with locking
- Understood LLD structure
- Asked the **right multithreading questions**
- Can now directly practice on top of real-world examples
