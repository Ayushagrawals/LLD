Perfect ‚Äî you're looking for **multithreading problems that are commonly asked in interviews** and that involve implementing data structures or system components like **LRU Cache**, **Thread-safe Queues**, etc. These are great for building both **concurrency and design** skills.

Here's a curated list of **multithreading-based problems** that are **system-design flavored**, just like LRU Cache. These mimic real-world scenarios and are great for interview prep:

---

### üîÅ Core Multithreading + Data Structure Problems

| Problem | Description | Concepts Practiced |
|--------|-------------|--------------------|
| **Thread-safe LRU Cache** | Design an LRU Cache where multiple threads can read/write | `ReentrantLock`, `ConcurrentHashMap`, `Doubly Linked List` |
| **Thread-safe Queue (BlockingQueue)** | Implement a blocking queue with `enqueue()` and `dequeue()` that waits when full/empty | `wait()`, `notify()`, bounded buffer problem |
| **Thread-safe Stack** | Push/pop with multithreading support | `synchronized`, `Lock`, atomic operations |
| **Producer-Consumer Pattern** | Classic multithreading problem using shared buffer | `wait()`, `notifyAll()`, `Semaphore` |
| **Read-Write Lock** | Implement a data structure where reads can happen concurrently but writes need exclusive access | `ReadWriteLock`, `ReentrantReadWriteLock` |
| **Thread-safe Counter** | Implement a counter that's safely incremented by multiple threads | `AtomicInteger`, `synchronized`, `Lock` |
| **Rate Limiter** (Token Bucket or Leaky Bucket) | Limit the number of requests per time window | `Semaphore`, `ScheduledExecutorService`, atomic operations |

### üß† System Design Flavored Problems with Multithreading

| Problem | Real-world Mapping | Concepts Used |
|--------|----------------------|----------------|
| **Thread Pool Executor** | Similar to Java's `ExecutorService` | Custom thread management, task queue, worker threads |
| **Logger Rate Limiter** | Throttle how often messages can be logged per second | HashMap + timestamp, thread-safe design |
| **Multi-threaded Web Crawler** | Crawl URLs concurrently | `ThreadPool`, `ConcurrentHashSet`, BFS |
| **Dining Philosophers Problem** | Models resource allocation and deadlocks | `Lock`, `Semaphore`, avoid deadlocks |
| **Barber Shop Problem** | Waiting area & sleeping barber thread | Classic semaphore problem |
| **Reader-Writer Problem** | Multiple readers but only one writer | `ReadWriteLock`, fairness |
| **Asynchronous Job Scheduler** | Like a cronjob system with multi-threading | `DelayQueue`, `PriorityQueue`, thread-safe scheduler |

### üß© Advanced or Java-Specific Challenges

| Problem | Highlights |
|--------|------------|
| Implement your own `CountDownLatch` | Learn how countdown mechanisms work under the hood |
| Build a `CyclicBarrier` | Synchronize a fixed number of threads before proceeding |
| Concurrent access to file cache | Simulates shared access to resource (file system) |
| Simulate elevator system with multiple threads | Each elevator runs on its own thread, interacting via shared request queue |
| Design Thread-safe Singleton (with double-checked locking) | Patterns & pitfalls in singleton implementations |

### üõ† Suggestion: Practice in this order
1. **Start with data structures**: LRU Cache, BlockingQueue, Stack
2. **Then do classic patterns**: Producer-Consumer, Reader-Writer
3. **Then system design components**: Thread Pool, Scheduler
4. **Finally real-world simulations**: Web Crawler, Elevator, Logger
