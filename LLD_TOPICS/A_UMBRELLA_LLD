 INVENTORY Management
📌 What Kind of LLD Questions Can You Solve With This?
1️⃣ Retail & E-commerce Inventory Systems (Like Amazon, Walmart, Flipkart)
💡 Question: Design an inventory management system for a multi-store retail company where products are categorized and stored in blocks.
✔ Same principles → Store → Cabin → Block → InventoryManager

2️⃣ Warehouse & Logistics Management (Like Amazon Warehouses, BigBasket)
💡 Question: Design a warehouse system where products are stored in different sections and fetched when needed.
✔ Just replace Block → WarehouseSection but the logic is the same!
✔ InventoryManager still fetches items based on category & stock.

3️⃣ Parking Lot System (Like Ola, Uber Parking)
💡 Question: Design a parking lot where vehicles are stored in blocks and each block has multiple parking spots.
✔ Block → ParkingLotSection
✔ Item → Vehicle
✔ InventoryManager → ParkingManager (Assigns & tracks available spots)

4️⃣ Food Delivery System (Like Swiggy, Zomato)
💡 Question: Design a system where restaurants store food items in categories and update inventory in real-time.
✔ Block → FoodCategory (like Biryani, Pizza, etc.)
✔ ItemDetails → FoodItem (Contains restaurant, price, stock, etc.)
✔ InventoryManager → MenuManager (Manages availability & stock updates)

5️⃣ Library Management System (Like Kindle, Online Bookstores)
💡 Question: Design a library system where books are categorized and each book has multiple copies.
✔ Block → Bookshelf
✔ Item → Book (title, author, genre)
✔ ItemDetails → BookCopy (edition, availability, condition)
✔ InventoryManager → LibraryManager (Handles book allocation, searches, and stock updates)
