🔥 The 4 Umbrella LLDs to Cover 80% of Infra Interviews
If you master these four, you can handle most infra LLD interview questions:
1️⃣ Distributed Queue System (Kafka, RabbitMQ) → Covers messaging, event-driven systems, microservices
2️⃣ API Rate Limiter (Cloudflare, AWS API Gateway) → Covers traffic control, scaling, security
3️⃣ Monitoring & Observability (Prometheus, ELK, Jaeger) → Covers logging, metrics, tracing, debugging
4️⃣ Distributed Storage (AWS S3, Dropbox, Google Drive) → Covers scalability, fault tolerance, cloud storage

💡 Bonus: Each of these overlaps with other major infra concepts (e.g., caching, logging, API gateways).
