Low-Level Design (LLD) Practice Guide

Overview

Low-Level Design (LLD) involves designing the core components of a system, focusing on class structure, API interactions, database schema, and scalability techniques. LLD can be categorized into three major types based on scope and complexity:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Application-Level LLD (Business Logic Layer)

Focus Areas:

Class Diagrams & Object-Oriented Design (OOD)

API Design (REST/gRPC, Input/Output Formats, Authentication)

Database Schema (SQL vs NoSQL, Indexing, Transactions)

Business Logic & Design Patterns

Examples:

Designing a Hotel Booking System

Implementing a Payment Gateway

Creating an Inventory Management System

Interview Expectations:

Clearly define classes, relationships, and responsibilities.

Explain how APIs interact with different entities.

Justify database choices and data modeling decisions.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Scaling & Infra-Level LLD (Service Layer)  -

Focus Areas:

Caching Strategies (Redis, CDN, Database Caching)

Messaging & Event-Driven Systems (Kafka, RabbitMQ, AWS SQS)

API Rate Limiting (Token Bucket, Leaky Bucket, API Gateway Throttling)

Observability (Logging, Monitoring, Distributed Tracing with Prometheus, ELK, Jaeger)

Examples:

Designing a Distributed Queue System (Kafka, RabbitMQ, SQS)

Implementing an API Rate Limiter

Architecting a Monitoring & Observability System

Scaling a Distributed Storage System (AWS S3, Dropbox, Google Drive)

Interview Expectations:

Show how to scale a system using caching, sharding, replication.

Explain asynchronous processing with messaging systems.

Discuss how to handle failures using retries, rate limiting, and circuit breakers (Hystrix, Resilience4j).

3Ô∏è‚É£ Cloud-Based LLD (AWS-Focused) (Infrastructure Layer)

Focus Areas:

Compute: EKS, ECS, Lambda

Networking: API Gateway vs ALB, VPC Design, NAT, PrivateLink

Storage: RDS, DynamoDB, S3, Caching with ElastiCache

Security & Scaling: IAM, Auto-scaling, WAF, CloudFront

Examples:

Scaling an EKS-Based Microservice

API Gateway vs Load Balancer ‚Äì When to Use What?

Deploying & Scaling a Microservices-Based E-Commerce Platform on AWS

Interview Expectations:

Justify compute and storage choices for scalability.

Design a highly available, fault-tolerant architecture.

Show how networking and security configurations impact application performance.

üìå Recommended Approach: Bottom-Up Learning

To avoid confusion and structure your learning efficiently:

Start with Cloud-Based LLD (AWS, Networking, Security, Scaling) üèóÔ∏è ‚Üí Learn foundational infrastructure concepts.

Move to Scaling & Infra-Level LLD (Caching, Queues, Rate Limiting, Observability) üîß ‚Üí Understand how services communicate and scale.

Finally, master Application-Level LLD (Class Diagrams, APIs, DB Design, Business Logic) üì¶ ‚Üí Design a full-featured system using all layers.

üîπ Why This Order?

‚úÖ Cloud & Infra decisions affect scalability ‚Äì You need infra knowledge first before designing the high-level application.
‚úÖ Infra LLD reuses AWS concepts ‚Äì Queues, caching, and monitoring work on top of cloud services.
‚úÖ Application LLD depends on both ‚Äì A hotel booking system will use caching, queues, and AWS infra.

üéØ How to Use This Guide?

Pick a practice problem (e.g., Hotel Booking System).

Start by designing the Application LLD (Classes, APIs, DB Schema).

Enhance it with Scaling & Infra-Level LLD (Caching, Messaging, Monitoring, Fault Tolerance).

Finally, map it to Cloud-Based LLD (AWS Services, Deployment, Auto-scaling, Security).

By following this structured approach, you will develop a complete, scalable, and production-ready LLD solution. üöÄ
