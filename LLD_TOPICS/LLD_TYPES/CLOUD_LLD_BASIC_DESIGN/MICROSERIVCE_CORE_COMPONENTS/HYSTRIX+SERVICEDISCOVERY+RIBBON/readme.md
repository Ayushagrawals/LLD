LLD Example of Retry Mechanism with Service Discovery, Hystrix, and Ribbon:
Here’s a simplified Low-Level Design (LLD) of the system that incorporates all three components.

1. Service A (Client) Requests Service B (Server)
   Service Discovery:

Service A queries Service Discovery (e.g., Eureka) to get the list of available instances of Service B.

Ribbon (Load Balancing):

Ribbon picks one of the available instances of Service B and forwards the request.

If the request fails, Ribbon retries the request, following a predefined retry policy (e.g., 3 retries with exponential backoff).

Hystrix:

The request to Service B is wrapped inside Hystrix to provide fault tolerance.

If all retries fail, Hystrix's circuit breaker is triggered, preventing further requests to the failing service and providing a fallback response.

2. Sequence of Events:
   Service A → Service Registry (Eureka) → Query for instances of Service B

Ribbon → Select an instance of Service B (load balancing)

Service A sends a request to Service B

If the request fails:

Ribbon retries the request based on its retry policy (e.g., exponential backoff).

If retries are exhausted:

Hystrix's circuit breaker triggers.

Hystrix provides a fallback response (e.g., a default value or cached response).

If Service B becomes available again, Hystrix closes the circuit and normal communication resumes.

3. Components Involved in the Retry Flow:
   Service Discovery (Eureka/Consul/Zookeeper): Used to find available instances of Service B.

Ribbon (Client-Side Load Balancer): Responsible for selecting the best instance and retrying the request.

Hystrix (Circuit Breaker/Fault Tolerance): Manages retries, circuit breaking, and fallbacks in case of service failures.

In Summary:
Service Discovery helps microservices discover each other dynamically.

Ribbon is used for client-side load balancing and handles retries when a request to another service fails.

Hystrix provides fault tolerance, handling failures gracefully, by retrying the request and activating circuit breakers when retries are exhausted. It also provides fallbacks to ensure the system continues functioning even in failure scenarios.

These components, working together, ensure that the system remains resilient, even if services experience intermittent failures. You can represent this in your Cloud-Based LLD to ensure all the retry and fault-tolerance mechanisms are considered in your design.

Q

so microservice has the some replica running some are not running let say b microservice and a service trying to call it now all replica with ip address and port present in the service discovery db and it try to querie sthe failed replica so ribbon will take crea to query the right healthy replica of the microservice? cant this service discorery handle

ChatGPT said:
Yes, Ribbon plays a crucial role in ensuring that requests are routed to healthy instances of a service. However, you're correct to question whether Service Discovery can handle this by itself. Let's break it down:

1. Service Discovery:
   Service Discovery (e.g., Eureka, Consul, Zookeeper) maintains a registry of services and their available instances (IP and port), including the status of each instance (whether it's healthy or not).

Service instances are registered and de-registered from the service discovery registry dynamically. Each instance can report its health status (e.g., via a health check endpoint).

Service Discovery helps the client (e.g., Service A) find the available Service B instances, but it doesn't handle load balancing or routing requests to healthy instances by itself.

2. Ribbon (Client-Side Load Balancer):
   Ribbon integrates with Service Discovery to query the available instances of Service B from the registry (e.g., Eureka). It is responsible for load balancing and ensuring that requests are routed to a healthy instance of the service.

If there are multiple instances of Service B (some healthy, some not), Ribbon can:

Filter out unhealthy instances: Ribbon knows which instances are available and can avoid routing requests to instances that are not healthy (assuming the health check mechanism is in place).

Retry requests: If an instance is temporarily unavailable or fails, Ribbon can retry the request to another healthy instance of Service B.

So, Ribbon plays the key role of ensuring that requests are sent only to healthy instances and handling retries in case of failure. Service Discovery provides the list of instances, but Ribbon ensures that only healthy instances are selected.

3. Can Service Discovery Handle This?
   While Service Discovery provides the information about available instances of a service, it doesn't inherently manage routing traffic or retrying requests to unhealthy instances. Here's why Ribbon (or a similar load balancing solution) is still necessary:

Service Discovery only provides a list of service instances (with their IP addresses and ports). It doesn't manage which instances are healthy or ensure that requests are routed to healthy instances automatically.

For example, if Service A queries Service Discovery (Eureka), it may get a list of instances for Service B:

Instance 1: healthy

Instance 2: unhealthy

Instance 3: healthy

Service Discovery doesn't know which instance to choose or handle retrying requests if an unhealthy instance is chosen. This is where Ribbon comes in.

Ribbon, integrated with Service Discovery, can monitor the health of service instances and route requests to only the healthy ones. It ensures that the request is routed to an active and responsive instance.

How Ribbon and Service Discovery Work Together:
Service A queries Service Discovery (e.g., Eureka) for Service B.

Service Discovery returns a list of all available instances, both healthy and unhealthy.

Ribbon then picks an instance from this list.

Ribbon checks the health status of the instances. If an unhealthy instance is present, it can either:

Skip the unhealthy instance and choose another healthy one.

If retries are enabled, Ribbon will attempt to route the request to other healthy instances, using the retry policy.

If Ribbon's retries are exhausted and all instances are unhealthy, Hystrix can come into play by opening the circuit breaker and falling back to a default response or cached data.

Example Scenario:
Service B has three replicas:

Replica 1: Healthy

Replica 2: Unhealthy (down)

Replica 3: Healthy

Service A wants to call Service B:

Service A queries Service Discovery (Eureka) to get the list of instances for Service B.

The registry returns all three instances, including the unhealthy one.

Ribbon uses the list of instances from Service Discovery and:

Excludes the unhealthy replica (because it is marked as down, via the health check mechanism).

Selects a healthy instance (Replica 1 or Replica 3).

If it chooses Replica 2 (by mistake), Ribbon will retry with another healthy instance.

If all instances are unhealthy, Hystrix can intervene by opening the circuit breaker and providing a fallback response.

Key Takeaways:
Service Discovery provides the list of instances and their status, but it doesn't handle the routing of requests to healthy instances.

Ribbon integrates with Service Discovery to perform client-side load balancing, ensuring requests are sent to healthy instances, and also handles retries and retries policies.

Service Discovery and Ribbon work together: Service Discovery provides the available instances, and Ribbon ensures requests go to the healthy ones.

Thus, while Service Discovery provides the list of service instances, it is Ribbon that is responsible for load balancing, handling retries, and ensuring that the request is routed to a healthy instance.
