Pre Commit similr to two 2 phase commit but if coordinator fails
Can commit -few set of macine if coordinator fail and we can't take descision pre commit and partiticapnt decide
to do can commit or not. If it is staate of no abort the transaction and do the can commit. You will take a lock
and send a can commit message. Every other state machine again

You're absolutely asking the **right deep question**. 👏  
Let’s **dive into Three-Phase Commit (3PC)** and clarify **why “canCommit” exists**, and how it avoids the blocking problem seen in 2PC — even if the **coordinator fails**.

---

## 🔁 Let’s first look at the **motivation behind 3PC**

In **2PC**, the biggest issue is:

> ❌ **Participants get stuck** in a PREPARED state if the coordinator crashes — they can’t decide to commit or rollback on their own.

So, 3PC introduces **an additional phase** to reduce blocking:

- Participants can **safely commit or rollback**, even if the coordinator crashes — thanks to extra coordination.

---

## 🔍 The 3 Phases in 3PC

| Phase             | Description                                                 |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1️⃣ **CanCommit?** | Coordinator asks: “Can you commit?” (vote phase)            |
| 2️⃣ **PreCommit**  | Coordinator says: “Prepare to commit, but don’t commit yet” |
| 3️⃣ **DoCommit**   | Coordinator says: “Now commit”                              |

Let’s break them down with **intent and recovery behavior**.

---

## 🔸 1️⃣ CanCommit Phase

**Coordinator → Participants:**

> “Can you commit transaction `txn123`?”

**Participants:**

- Check constraints (e.g., DB state, availability).
- Reply `YES` (can commit) or `NO` (cannot commit).

🧠 **No state changes yet. Just a vote.**

---

## 🔸 2️⃣ PreCommit Phase (NEW in 3PC)

**Coordinator:**

- If all say `YES`, logs `PRECOMMIT` and sends `PRECOMMIT` to all.

**Participants:**

- Log `PRECOMMIT`.
- Acknowledge back to coordinator: “I’m ready.”
- Importantly: now they’re in a **"prepared-to-commit but timeout-safe" state**.

🧠 Here’s the magic:  
Participants are now **allowed to commit on their own** if coordinator fails and timeout occurs — **because all participants are in agreement**.

This phase ensures everyone is in sync **before commit**.

---

## 🔸 3️⃣ DoCommit Phase

**Coordinator:**

- Logs `COMMIT`, sends `COMMIT` to all participants.

**Participants:**

- Commit the transaction and log `COMMIT`.

---

## ✅ Recovery Behavior — Why 3PC is Better

Now back to your core question:

> If the coordinator crashes after `PRECOMMIT`, shouldn’t participants rollback?

👉 **No!** Because:

- Every participant has logged `PRECOMMIT`, which means:
  > “Everyone is ready. I can safely commit later even without the coordinator.”

So after a timeout, participants can **coordinate among themselves** or **decide to commit** because:

- There is **no uncertainty**.
- The protocol ensures **no partial commits or rollbacks** will occur.

### 📌 TL;DR:

- In 2PC, the uncertainty after `PREPARE` causes blocking.
- In 3PC, the **PRECOMMIT phase gives certainty**: all parties agree they can commit.
- So even if coordinator dies, the system can move forward after timeout.

## 🔁 Timeline Recap:

```text
Phase 1: CanCommit?
    - Coordinator: “Can you commit?”
    - All Participants: “YES”

Phase 2: PreCommit
    - Coordinator: “Prepare to commit”
    - All Participants log PRECOMMIT and are ready

Phase 3: DoCommit
    - Coordinator: “Commit now”
    - All Participants: Commit

Recovery:
    - If coordinator dies after PreCommit
    - Participants: Commit safely after timeout
```

---

## 🧠 Analogy

Imagine:

- Everyone in a team says “I’m ready to go live”.
- Before hitting the final "Go", the manager says "Get into launch positions" (**PreCommit**).
- If the manager disappears, everyone still knows they agreed to launch — so the team can launch.
