# **Distributed Logging & Monitoring LLD**

This document provides an architecture for setting up **Distributed Logging & Monitoring** using various tools like **AWS CloudWatch, ELK, Prometheus, Jaeger, and OpenTelemetry**. It covers the collection of logs, monitoring of metrics, and tracing of requests across microservices.

---

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Objective**

In a **microservices-based architecture**, it is essential to collect logs, metrics, and trace data for observability, troubleshooting, and performance optimization. This solution covers:

- **Collecting logs** from microservices
- **Monitoring infrastructure metrics** (CPU, memory, disk, etc.)
- **Distributed tracing** for request flow visualization
- **Centralized alerting** for proactive issue detection

---

## **2Ô∏è‚É£ Key Components**

Here‚Äôs a quick overview of the components involved:

- **Fluentd / Logstash**: Collect logs from multiple microservices and send them to **Elasticsearch**
- **Elasticsearch**: Stores and indexes logs for fast search and retrieval
- **Kibana**: Visualizes logs and provides a search interface
- **Prometheus**: Collects infrastructure-level metrics (CPU, memory, disk, etc.)
- **Grafana**: Visualizes metrics collected by Prometheus
- **Jaeger/OpenTelemetry**: Provides distributed tracing across microservices
- **Alertmanager**: Sends alerts based on metric thresholds (e.g., high CPU usage, failed requests)

---

## **3Ô∏è‚É£ LLD Solution ‚Äì How Components Interact**

### **Step 1: Logging Setup (Application-Level Logs)**

- **Microservices** generate logs (using SLF4J, Log4j, etc.)
- **Fluentd/Logstash** collects logs from services and sends them to **Elasticsearch**
- **Elasticsearch** indexes logs and stores them for fast searching
- **Kibana** provides a UI for searching and analyzing logs

### **Step 2: Monitoring Setup (Infrastructure Metrics)**

- **Prometheus** scrapes metrics from microservices using `/actuator/prometheus` endpoint
- **Node Exporter** collects host-level stats (e.g., CPU, memory)
- **Prometheus** stores time-series data and visualizes it via **Grafana**
- **Alertmanager** triggers alerts based on thresholds (e.g., CPU usage > 80%)

### **Step 3: Distributed Tracing Setup**

- **OpenTelemetry SDK** is used to instrument microservices for tracing
- **Jaeger** traces request flows across multiple services
- **Jaeger UI** visualizes latency and bottlenecks across services

### **Log Entry Table (for Elasticsearch)**

```plaintext
LogEntry {
  id: UUID,
  timestamp: DateTime,
  microservice: String,
  logLevel: Enum(INFO, WARN, ERROR),
  message: String,
  traceId: UUID,
  spanId: UUID
}
```

### **Metric Table (for Prometheus)**

```plaintext
Metric {
  id: UUID,
  timestamp: DateTime,
  service: String,
  metricType: Enum(CPU, MEMORY, DISK),
  value: Float
}
```

### **Trace Table (for Jaeger)**

```plaintext
Trace {
  traceId: UUID,
  spanId: UUID,
  parentSpanId: UUID,
  service: String,
  durationMs: Float,
  operation: String
}
```

## **6Ô∏è‚É£ Interview-Ready Answers**

### **Q1: How do you handle log collection across multiple services?**

- **Fluentd** aggregates logs from all services and sends them to **Elasticsearch**. **Kibana** provides search and analysis capabilities.

### **Q2: How do you monitor service health and infrastructure metrics?**

- **Prometheus** scrapes microservices' metrics from the `/actuator/prometheus` endpoint. It also collects **node-level stats** using **Node Exporter**. **Grafana** visualizes the metrics.

### **Q3: How do you debug latency issues across microservices?**

- **Jaeger/OpenTelemetry** traces requests across services using unique **trace IDs** to identify slow requests and bottlenecks.

### **Q4: How do you set up alerts for failures?**

- **Prometheus** metrics are configured in **Alertmanager**, which triggers alerts when predefined thresholds are crossed (e.g., high CPU usage, failed requests).

## **7Ô∏è‚É£ Next Steps**

This architecture covers the basic **logging**, **monitoring**, and **tracing** setup. For **scalability** and **high availability**, ensure that you:

- Set up **Prometheus HA** and **Elasticsearch clusters**
- Use **Grafana** for advanced dashboards
- Set up **Alertmanager** for high-priority alerts
