Q -so it doesn't require service discovery here as it taking to microservice like other microservice talking to each other

Correct, **service discovery** is not strictly required for Prometheus when it scrapes metrics from a **Kubernetes Service**. Here's why:

### **Why Service Discovery Isn't Needed for Prometheus Scraping Metrics**:

1. **Kubernetes Service as a Stable Endpoint**:
   - In Kubernetes, a **Service** acts as a stable endpoint, providing a consistent DNS name (e.g., `spring-boot-app-service`) that resolves to the current set of healthy pods behind it.
   - Prometheus doesn't need to discover the individual pods or their IP addresses. It simply scrapes the **Kubernetes Service**, which automatically routes the requests to the healthy pods (using Kubernetes' built-in load balancing).
2. **Prometheus Configuration**:

   - In the **Prometheus configuration file (`prometheus.yml`)**, you can use **Kubernetes service discovery** to define the target. This doesn't involve manual service discovery (like you would do with Ribbon or Eureka); instead, it uses **Kubernetes' internal DNS** to resolve the service name and route the request to the appropriate pods behind the service.

   Example of a scrape configuration in Prometheus:

   ```yaml
   scrape_configs:
     - job_name: "spring-boot-app"
       kubernetes_sd_configs:
         - role: service
       relabel_configs:
         - source_labels: [__meta_kubernetes_service_name]
           action: keep
           regex: spring-boot-app-service
   ```

3. **No Need for Manual Discovery**:
   - Prometheus isn't discovering services in the same way microservices discover each other. Prometheus just scrapes the endpoint exposed by the **Kubernetes Service**.
   - If a pod in the service goes down or if more pods are added (e.g., due to scaling), Kubernetes will update the endpoints associated with the service automatically, and Prometheus will continue scraping the healthy pods.

### **Comparison to Microservice Communication**:

- When microservices need to communicate with each other (using Ribbon, for example), **service discovery** is required to locate the correct instance of another service based on load balancing strategies.
- For Prometheus, service discovery isn't the same because it doesn't need to "find" specific instances of microservices. It simply scrapes metrics exposed by a **Kubernetes Service**, which abstracts away the complexity of pod management.

### **In Summary**:

- **Prometheus does not need a service discovery mechanism** like Ribbon or Eureka. It only requires a stable **Kubernetes Service** endpoint to scrape metrics.
- The **Kubernetes Service** handles routing requests to the available pods, and Prometheus scrapes the metrics from the service, not the individual pods.
