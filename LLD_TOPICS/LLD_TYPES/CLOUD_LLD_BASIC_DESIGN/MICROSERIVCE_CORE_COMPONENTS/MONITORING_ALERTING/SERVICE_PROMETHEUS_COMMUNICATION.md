4 Imp question asked here to understand how prometheus interacts read through it
//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
In this setup, where you have a **microservice** with 10 replicas behind a **Kubernetes Service**, the way Prometheus scrapes metrics from the microservices is as follows:

### **How Prometheus Scrapes Metrics from Microservices with Multiple Replicas:**

1. **Kubernetes Service Abstraction**:

   - You have a **Kubernetes Service** (e.g., `spring-boot-app-service`) that fronts the 10 replica pods. The **Kubernetes Service** acts as a stable endpoint that handles the routing of traffic to the pods based on internal load balancing.
   - This service abstracts away the individual pod IPs, providing a single endpoint (e.g., `spring-boot-app-service:8080`).

2. **Metrics Endpoint Exposed by Microservices**:

   - Each replica pod of your microservice exposes an **HTTP endpoint** (e.g., `/actuator/prometheus` for a Spring Boot app) that exposes metrics to Prometheus.
   - The microservices themselves (in each pod) are exposing metrics in a Prometheus-compatible format.

3. **Prometheus Scrapes the Service**:
   - Prometheus is configured to scrape the **Kubernetes Service** endpoint (`spring-boot-app-service:8080` in this example), not the individual pod endpoints.
   - **Prometheus will use the Kubernetes Service as the target** and make an HTTP request to this service. The service will forward the request to one of the healthy pods (which are behind it).
4. **Kubernetes Service Load Balancing**:
   - Kubernetes handles the load balancing between the pods automatically. When Prometheus scrapes the **Kubernetes Service**, the request is forwarded to one of the available pods, and the pod responds with the metrics.
   - If more pods are added or removed (e.g., due to autoscaling), Kubernetes automatically updates the service's endpoints to reflect the new pod state. Prometheus will continue scraping the service, and Kubernetes will ensure it routes to the correct pods.

### **Kube-State-Metrics Role**:

- **Kube-State-Metrics** is a separate component that provides **Kubernetes-specific metrics**, such as the number of pods, nodes, and other resources in your cluster, as well as their states (e.g., whether they are healthy or not).
- **Kube-State-Metrics** is typically used to provide **cluster-level metrics** and is not directly related to your application's metrics (like the ones exposed by your microservice). It is a separate service that Prometheus scrapes to collect cluster-related metrics.

### **Kubernetes Service vs. Kube-State-Metrics**:

- **Kubernetes Service**: Prometheus scrapes the metrics from your **microservices** via the service endpoint. It doesn't need to directly communicate with individual pods.
- **Kube-State-Metrics**: Prometheus scrapes this component to collect **cluster-level metrics** (e.g., the health of pods, deployments, nodes, etc.).

### **Summary**:

1. **Prometheus Scraping**:
   - Prometheus scrapes the **Kubernetes Service** (`spring-boot-app-service:8080`).
   - The **Kubernetes Service** automatically handles routing the request to one of the 10 pods behind it, which exposes the Prometheus metrics.
2. **Kube-State-Metrics**:
   - **Kube-State-Metrics** is used to expose Kubernetes resource-related metrics (like pod states, deployments, node states, etc.), not the application metrics.
   - Prometheus scrapes **Kube-State-Metrics** separately for cluster health information.

Would you like further details on **how Prometheus collects cluster-level metrics** from Kube-State-Metrics or how the configuration for scraping these services would look?

Q - so is there a particular endpoint of servie that promethus hits is it like spring-boot-app-service:8080/actuator/prometheus? as it is exposed by the application

Ans - Yes, you're absolutely right! When Prometheus scrapes metrics from a Spring Boot application (or any other service that exposes metrics in a Prometheus-compatible format), it typically hits a specific endpoint that the application exposes.

In a **Spring Boot application**, the common endpoint for Prometheus metrics is:

```
/actuator/prometheus
```

So, assuming your **Spring Boot microservice** is running behind a Kubernetes service (e.g., `spring-boot-app-service`) on port 8080, **Prometheus will scrape the following endpoint**:

```
spring-boot-app-service:8080/actuator/prometheus
```

### **Key Points**:

1. **Endpoint Structure**:
   - The **`/actuator/prometheus`** endpoint is exposed by the Spring Boot application via the **Spring Boot Actuator** module.
   - This endpoint provides metrics in a **Prometheus-compatible format**.
2. **Kubernetes Service**:

   - The **Kubernetes Service** (e.g., `spring-boot-app-service:8080`) acts as a stable endpoint for Prometheus to scrape the metrics. It will forward requests to one of the healthy replica pods behind the service.

3. **Prometheus Scraping**:

   - Prometheus is configured to scrape this service endpoint (`spring-boot-app-service:8080/actuator/prometheus`).
   - The Kubernetes service will load balance the request to one of the healthy pods, and the pod will respond with the metrics exposed at `/actuator/prometheus`.

4. **Why This Works**:
   - The **Spring Boot microservice** exposes its metrics at the `/actuator/prometheus` endpoint.
   - Kubernetes ensures that the **Kubernetes Service** always has the correct endpoints for the pods (even if the pods are scaled up or down), so Prometheus just hits the service, and Kubernetes handles routing to the right pod.

### **Prometheus Configuration**:

You need to configure **Prometheus** to scrape this endpoint. Here's how the scrape configuration would look like in Prometheus' `prometheus.yml`:

```yaml
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: "spring-boot-app"
    kubernetes_sd_configs:
      - role: endpoints
    relabel_configs:
      - source_labels: [__meta_kubernetes_service_name]
        action: keep
        regex: spring-boot-app-service
      - source_labels: [__meta_kubernetes_namespace]
        action: keep
        regex: default
    metrics_path: /actuator/prometheus
    scheme: http
```

### **What Happens Here**:

- **`kubernetes_sd_configs`**: This tells Prometheus to discover Kubernetes services as targets.
- **`metrics_path: /actuator/prometheus`**: Specifies the path where Prometheus can scrape the application metrics.
- **`relabel_configs`**: Ensures Prometheus only scrapes metrics from the specific service (`spring-boot-app-service` in the `default` namespace).

This way, Prometheus continuously scrapes metrics from the `/actuator/prometheus` endpoint exposed by your Spring Boot application.

Does this help clarify how Prometheus scrapes metrics from your microservices?
//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
Q - so how does service know this time promethus hit me not any other microservice so i need to provide infor on the the endpoint of the /acuator/prometheus because prometheus is hitting like other normal would do

Ans - Great question! Let's clarify how the **Kubernetes Service** and the **Spring Boot application** ensure that Prometheus is hitting the correct endpoint, particularly when it's one of several microservices behind the same service.

### **How the Kubernetes Service Routes Requests**:

In Kubernetes, a **Service** is essentially an abstraction over a set of pods, allowing you to access them using a stable DNS name (like `spring-boot-app-service:8080`). The Service itself performs the following functions:

- **Load balancing**: When Prometheus or any other client makes a request to the service (e.g., `spring-boot-app-service:8080`), the service forwards the request to one of the available pods (which are replicas of your microservice).
- **Pod discovery**: The Service always knows the list of active pods behind it, and it routes traffic to them accordingly.

### **How Prometheus and the Spring Boot Service Work**:

- **Prometheus** will send a request to the **Kubernetes service** (`spring-boot-app-service:8080/actuator/prometheus`), but it doesn’t need to be concerned about which specific pod it hits. The Kubernetes **Service** will handle the routing.
- **Kubernetes Service** ensures that the request is forwarded to one of the pods running your **Spring Boot application**. Since the Service is a stable endpoint, Kubernetes will direct the request to one of the healthy pods (from the set of replicas).

- **Spring Boot Application** (running behind the Service) exposes the `/actuator/prometheus` endpoint. As long as the **Spring Boot application** is correctly configured to expose this endpoint, it doesn't need to know whether the request is from Prometheus or from another microservice.

### **How Prometheus "Knows" What to Hit**:

- Prometheus is configured to scrape the **/actuator/prometheus** endpoint on the service's exposed port (e.g., `spring-boot-app-service:8080/actuator/prometheus`).
- The Kubernetes Service automatically knows which pods are healthy and will route the request to the right pod.

### **Why There's No Need to Identify "This Is Prometheus"**:

- The Spring Boot application (behind the Kubernetes service) **doesn't need to differentiate whether the request is from Prometheus or another service**. It will always respond with the metrics at `/actuator/prometheus` for any HTTP request that comes to that endpoint.
- Prometheus does not require the Spring Boot app to distinguish between itself and any other microservice because it is simply scraping an endpoint that exposes the application’s metrics. It’s Kubernetes that takes care of **routing the request** to one of the available pods.

### **Summing Up**:

- **Service Discovery**: Prometheus doesn't need to know which pod is serving the metrics; it only needs to know the service endpoint (`spring-boot-app-service:8080/actuator/prometheus`). Kubernetes will take care of directing the request to one of the available pods.
- **No Identification Needed**: The Spring Boot application doesn’t need to identify that Prometheus is scraping its metrics. It simply exposes the metrics via `/actuator/prometheus`, and any client (including Prometheus) can hit that endpoint to get metrics.

So, Prometheus is just scraping the `/actuator/prometheus` endpoint exposed by the service, and Kubernetes manages which pod gets the traffic.

Q -oaky so prometheus will call this spring-boot-app-service:8080/actuator/prometheus not this spring-boot-app-service:8080 if it do the service won't understnad and it will fail

Exactly! You’re right. Let me clarify:

- **Prometheus** is specifically configured to scrape the `/actuator/prometheus` endpoint for metrics. If Prometheus tries to scrape just `spring-boot-app-service:8080`, it will **not** receive the metrics because that endpoint doesn’t expose the Prometheus metrics.

- The correct URL for Prometheus to scrape is `spring-boot-app-service:8080/actuator/prometheus`. This is the endpoint where Spring Boot exposes application metrics in a format that Prometheus understands.

### What Happens If Prometheus Hits the Wrong Endpoint?

- If Prometheus is configured to scrape `spring-boot-app-service:8080` (without the `/actuator/prometheus` path), it will not get the metrics, because that is the base URL for your application, and **the service will not know how to respond with the metrics**.
- The service is only aware of the metrics at `/actuator/prometheus`, so if Prometheus tries to scrape the wrong URL, it will get a **404 Not Found** error (or no response if not correctly configured).

### Correct Configuration:

Prometheus should always scrape `spring-boot-app-service:8080/actuator/prometheus`. This is a well-known path for exposing application metrics in Spring Boot when the **Spring Actuator** is configured to expose Prometheus-compatible metrics.

### Final Point:

To summarize:

- **Prometheus Scrape URL**: `spring-boot-app-service:8080/actuator/prometheus`
- **Service Route**: The service will handle the request and route it to the correct pod.
- **Spring Boot Metrics Endpoint**: The Spring Boot app exposes metrics at `/actuator/prometheus`.
