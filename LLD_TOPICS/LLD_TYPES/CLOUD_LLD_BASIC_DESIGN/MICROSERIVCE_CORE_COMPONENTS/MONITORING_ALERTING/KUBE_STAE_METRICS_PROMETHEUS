Yes, **Prometheus** and **Kubernetes** metrics are closely linked, and **kube-state-metrics** plays a key role in this setup. Let's break down the setup and how Prometheus collects Kubernetes metrics using **kube-state-metrics** and **node-exporter** (for node-level metrics).

### **Prometheus Setup for Kubernetes Monitoring**

1. **Prometheus**: 
   Prometheus is an open-source monitoring system that collects and stores time-series data. It can scrape metrics from different services, including Kubernetes clusters, microservices, and node exporters.

2. **kube-state-metrics**:
   **kube-state-metrics** is a service that exposes the state of Kubernetes resources, like pods, nodes, deployments, replicasets, namespaces, etc., as metrics. These metrics are exposed in a Prometheus-compatible format. 

3. **Node Exporter**:
   While **kube-state-metrics** gives you Kubernetes resource states (like pod status, number of replicas, etc.), **node-exporter** gives you node-level metrics, such as CPU, memory, and disk usage. This is crucial for scaling decisions (e.g., Horizontal Pod Autoscaler or Cluster Autoscaler).

### **Flow of Metrics Collection**

Here's how Prometheus integrates with Kubernetes and uses **kube-state-metrics**:

#### **1. kube-state-metrics Pod**:
- **kube-state-metrics** is typically deployed as a **Pod** in your Kubernetes cluster. This pod watches the state of various Kubernetes resources (like pods, deployments, nodes, etc.) and exposes this information in a Prometheus-compatible format at an HTTP endpoint.
  
- **Example Metrics Exposed by kube-state-metrics**:
  - Pod status: How many pods are in `Pending`, `Running`, `Succeeded`, `Failed`, etc.
  - Deployment status: How many replicas are available, desired, or updated.
  - Namespace information.
  - Resource usage metrics (like CPU, memory, and storage for pods, deployments, etc.).

#### **2. Prometheus Scraping kube-state-metrics**:
- Prometheus is configured to **scrape** the metrics exposed by the **kube-state-metrics** service at regular intervals.
  
- For example, Prometheus can be configured to scrape metrics from **kube-state-metrics** every 30 seconds, gathering metrics like the number of running pods, pod health, resource allocation, and so on.
  
- Prometheus uses **Service Discovery** in Kubernetes to locate **kube-state-metrics** automatically. It can discover all services, including **kube-state-metrics**, through **Kubernetes' DNS or API**.

#### **3. Node Exporter (Optional)**:
- If you want to monitor node-level metrics (like CPU usage, memory, disk, and network), you deploy **node-exporter** on each node in your Kubernetes cluster.
  
- **node-exporter** collects low-level metrics about the host machine, such as:
  - CPU usage
  - Memory usage
  - Disk space
  - Network traffic
  
- Prometheus can scrape these node-level metrics via the **node-exporter** and use them to make scaling decisions.

#### **4. Prometheus Database**:
- Prometheus stores all the metrics it scrapes in a time-series database. These metrics are stored with a timestamp, which allows you to analyze trends over time, such as CPU utilization over the last 24 hours or the number of pods in a particular state.

#### **5. HPA and Metrics Consumption**:
- **Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA)** is configured to consume the metrics Prometheus exposes. For example, HPA can be set to scale the number of pods based on metrics like CPU usage (collected by Prometheus through **kube-state-metrics** and **node-exporter**).

- **Prometheus Adapter** or **Prometheus metrics server** is used to expose Prometheus metrics in a way that the Kubernetes HPA can consume them, enabling autoscaling based on real-time data.

        +------------------------+    +------------------------+

```

### **Key Configurations**:
1. **kube-state-metrics Deployment**: 
   You deploy **kube-state-metrics** as a pod within the Kubernetes cluster, which exposes metrics for Kubernetes resources like pods, deployments, and nodes. Here's an example YAML for a basic **kube-state-metrics** deployment:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: kube-state-metrics
  namespace: kube-system
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: kube-state-metrics
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: kube-state-metrics
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: kube-state-metrics
          image: quay.io/coreos/kube-state-metrics:v2.0.0
          ports:
            - name: http
              containerPort: 8080
```

2. **Prometheus Scrape Config**: 
   Prometheus can be configured to scrape the metrics exposed by **kube-state-metrics**. The scrape configuration for **kube-state-metrics** in Prometheus could look like this:

```yaml
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'kubernetes-state-metrics'
    kubernetes_sd_configs:
      - role: pod
        namespaces:
          names:
            - kube-system
    relabel_configs:
      - source_labels: [__meta_kubernetes_pod_label_app]
        target_label: app
```

This configuration will allow Prometheus to automatically discover and scrape metrics exposed by **kube-state-metrics**.

### **How to Deploy Prometheus with kube-state-metrics on Kubernetes**

1. **Install Prometheus using Helm**:
   If you're using Helm, you can install Prometheus with the following commands:
   
   ```bash
   helm repo add prometheus-community https://prometheus-community.github.io/helm-charts
   helm install prometheus prometheus-community/kube-prometheus-stack
   ```

   This will install Prometheus along with **kube-state-metrics** and **node-exporter**.

2. **Set Up Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA)**:
   You can configure the HPA to scale based on **Prometheus** metrics. First, you need to install the **Prometheus Adapter** to expose Prometheus metrics in a way HPA can consume.

   Example HPA configuration based on Prometheus metrics (like CPU):

```yaml
apiVersion: autoscaling/v2
kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler
metadata:
  name: example-app
  namespace: default
spec:
  scaleTargetRef:
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    name: example-app
  minReplicas: 1
  maxReplicas: 10
  metrics:
    - type: Resource
      resource:
        name: cpu
        target:
          type: Utilization
          averageUtilization: 80
```

This will scale the application based on CPU utilization, which Prometheus is scraping via **kube-state-metrics** and **node-exporter**.

### **Conclusion**:

- **Prometheus** scrapes metrics from **kube-state-metrics** (for Kubernetes resources) and **node-exporter** (for node-level metrics) and stores them in its time-series database.
- **Prometheus Adapter** or **Prometheus Metrics Server** can expose these metrics to **Horizontal Pod Autoscalers (HPA)** to scale your Kubernetes services.
- By using **Grafana**, you can visualize these metrics, and with **Alertmanager**, you can set up alerts when certain thresholds (like CPU or memory utilization) are breached.

This is a common setup in real-world production environments where **Prometheus** is used for Kubernetes monitoring, and **kube-state-metrics** provides detailed resource-level metrics.
