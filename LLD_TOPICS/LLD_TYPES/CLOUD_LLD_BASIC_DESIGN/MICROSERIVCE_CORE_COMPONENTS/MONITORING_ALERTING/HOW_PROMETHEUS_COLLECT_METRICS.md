Yes, you’re right! Let me clarify how Prometheus interacts with your Spring Boot application and how Kubernetes services and replica pods come into the picture.

### **How Prometheus Scrapes Metrics in a Kubernetes Environment**

1. **Prometheus Scrapes from a Service, Not Directly from Pods**:

   - In Kubernetes, **Prometheus typically scrapes metrics from a service** (e.g., `spring-boot-app-service:8080`), not directly from individual pods.
   - **Kubernetes Service** acts as an abstraction over the underlying pods. It provides a stable endpoint for Prometheus to scrape metrics without worrying about which pod is currently handling the traffic.

2. **Kubernetes Service and Pods**:

   - Your **Spring Boot application** is running in **multiple replica pods** for high availability. These pods are behind a Kubernetes **Service** (e.g., `spring-boot-app-service`), which load-balances traffic across all available pods.
   - The **Service** will expose an endpoint (like `http://spring-boot-app-service:8080/actuator/prometheus`), which will route requests to any healthy pod in the backend (this is how Kubernetes handles the routing).

3. **How Prometheus Works**:

   - Prometheus does not need to know about individual pods. Instead, it scrapes the **Kubernetes service** that exposes the metrics endpoint.
   - The service will automatically forward the scraping request to one of the available pod replicas behind it, based on the load balancing managed by Kubernetes.
   - **Prometheus configuration (`prometheus.yml`)** can define a **Kubernetes service** as the target to scrape metrics. It will scrape the service’s endpoint, and Kubernetes will ensure that the request is routed to one of the healthy pods.

4. **What About the Pods’ Status**:
   - Prometheus **doesn't directly scrape pod status** (e.g., health or availability). However, if you have **kube-state-metrics** deployed in your cluster, it provides metrics about the Kubernetes resources, including pod statuses (healthy, unhealthy, pending, etc.).
   - Prometheus can scrape **kube-state-metrics** to gather this information and then combine it with metrics from your Spring Boot application.

### **Example Scenario**:

- **Spring Boot Application**:

  - Each pod exposes metrics at `http://spring-boot-app-service:8080/actuator/prometheus`.
  - A **Kubernetes Service** (`spring-boot-app-service`) routes traffic to the available pods running the Spring Boot app.

- **Prometheus**:

  - In the **Prometheus configuration file** (`prometheus.yml`), you can set up a scrape job for the Kubernetes service:

  ```yaml
  scrape_configs:
    - job_name: "spring-boot-app"
      kubernetes_sd_configs:
        - role: service
      relabel_configs:
        - source_labels: [__meta_kubernetes_service_name]
          action: keep
          regex: spring-boot-app-service
  ```

- **Kubernetes**:
  - The Kubernetes service (`spring-boot-app-service`) will manage routing traffic to the healthy pods. If there’s scaling (more pods are added or removed), the service automatically updates its endpoints and ensures that Prometheus scrapes only healthy pods.

---

### **To Summarize**:

- Prometheus scrapes metrics from a **Kubernetes Service**, not directly from individual pods.
- The **Kubernetes Service** abstracts away the pod details and load-balances traffic between the available pods (replicas).
- Prometheus doesn’t directly track pod health, but you can get that information through **kube-state-metrics**, which can be scraped alongside your application metrics.
- **Kubernetes** handles pod status, scaling, and load balancing, while Prometheus just collects and stores metrics.
