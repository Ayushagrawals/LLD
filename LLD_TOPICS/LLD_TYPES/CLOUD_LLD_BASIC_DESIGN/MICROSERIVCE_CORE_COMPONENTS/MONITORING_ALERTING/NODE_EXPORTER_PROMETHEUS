Q - so just like service provide pod level metrices does node exporter provide node based metrics?
Yes, exactly! Just like how **microservices** provide **pod-level metrics** (e.g., using `/actuator/prometheus` for Spring Boot apps), **Node Exporter** provides **node-level metrics**. These metrics are related to the **host machine** (the node) on which the containerized applications or microservices are running.

### **Node Exporter Metrics**

The **Node Exporter** collects **host-level** statistics, such as:

- **CPU usage**: Overall CPU utilization, idle time, etc.
- **Memory usage**: Free memory, used memory, swap usage.
- **Disk usage**: Free disk space, disk I/O operations.
- **Network stats**: Network interface statistics (e.g., packets sent/received).
- **File system stats**: File system usage, inode usage.

### **How Node Exporter Works**

- **Node Exporter** runs as a **daemon** on each node (or VM, EC2 instance, etc.).
- It exposes a **/metrics** endpoint, typically on port `9100`.
- **Prometheus** scrapes this `/metrics` endpoint to collect these node-level metrics.

For example, **Prometheus** scrapes metrics like this:

```
http://<node-ip>:9100/metrics
```

### **Example of Metrics Collected by Node Exporter**

```plaintext
# HELP node_memory_MemFree_bytes Free memory in bytes
# TYPE node_memory_MemFree_bytes gauge
node_memory_MemFree_bytes 1.23456789e+07

# HELP node_cpu_seconds_total Total seconds the CPU has spent in different modes
# TYPE node_cpu_seconds_total counter
node_cpu_seconds_total{cpu="0",mode="idle"} 1.23456789e+06
```

### **How Node Exporter Helps with Monitoring**

- **CPU**: Helps monitor the nodeâ€™s CPU utilization, which can indicate whether your nodes are under heavy load.
- **Memory**: Tracks memory consumption, helping you understand whether your node is running out of memory.
- **Disk**: Provides disk space and I/O statistics, allowing you to monitor the available storage and identify bottlenecks.
- **Network**: Helps monitor the network activity, useful for detecting issues like network congestion.

By collecting this data, **Prometheus** helps you visualize infrastructure health and performance, especially when integrated with **Grafana**.

---

So, in summary:

- **Node Exporter** collects **host/node-level metrics** (like CPU, memory, disk, and network).
- **Prometheus** scrapes these metrics and stores them.
- These metrics are visualized via **Grafana** for monitoring node health.
