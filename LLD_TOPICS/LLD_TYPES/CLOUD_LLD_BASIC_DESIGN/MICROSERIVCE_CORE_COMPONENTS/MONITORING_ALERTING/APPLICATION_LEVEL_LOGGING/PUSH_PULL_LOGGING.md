# Push vs Pull-Based Monitoring

## Overview

Monitoring systems collect metrics from applications and infrastructure. There are two main approaches to retrieving this data:

1. **Push-Based Monitoring** ‚Üí The monitored system **sends (pushes)** data to a central monitoring system.
2. **Pull-Based Monitoring** ‚Üí The monitoring system **fetches (pulls)** data from the monitored system.

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Pull-Based Monitoring (Used by Prometheus)

### How It Works

- The **monitoring system (e.g., Prometheus)** periodically queries (pulls) metrics from services.
- Each service exposes an **HTTP endpoint (e.g., `/actuator/prometheus`)** with real-time metrics.
- Prometheus scrapes the data and stores it for querying & alerting.

### Example: Prometheus Pulling Metrics

- A Spring Boot app exposes `http://service-A:8080/actuator/prometheus`.
- Prometheus pulls data from this endpoint every **15s**.
- The data is stored in **Prometheus's time-series database (TSDB)**.

### Pros & When to Use?

‚úîÔ∏è **Better for dynamic environments** (e.g., Kubernetes, where services scale up/down).  
‚úîÔ∏è **No need to modify applications** (as long as they expose a metrics endpoint).  
‚úîÔ∏è **More reliable**, as Prometheus controls when and how often it scrapes data.  
‚úîÔ∏è **Efficient for short-lived services** (e.g., ephemeral pods in Kubernetes).

### Cons?

‚ùå Harder to use if you need to monitor **millions of distributed devices** (e.g., IoT).  
‚ùå Prometheus must **know all target services** (service discovery required).

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Push-Based Monitoring (Used by StatsD, CloudWatch, etc.)

### How It Works

- The application/service **actively sends (pushes) metrics** to a monitoring system.
- Metrics are sent to a **central collector (e.g., AWS CloudWatch, Graphite, StatsD)**.
- The collector stores the data for visualization, querying, and alerting.

### Example: AWS CloudWatch Pushing Logs

- A Lambda function or EC2 instance **pushes logs & metrics** to AWS CloudWatch.
- CloudWatch stores the data and triggers alerts when necessary.

### Pros & When to Use?

‚úîÔ∏è **Works well for IoT & edge devices** (where it's hard to "pull" metrics).  
‚úîÔ∏è **Great for serverless applications (AWS Lambda, Azure Functions)**.  
‚úîÔ∏è **Better for event-driven architectures** (e.g., logs, error reports).

### Cons?

‚ùå Harder to scale efficiently if **too many services push data**.  
‚ùå **Data loss risk** if the service crashes before sending metrics.

## üöÄ When to Use Pull vs Push?

| Feature                       | **Pull-Based (Prometheus)**                        | **Push-Based (CloudWatchStatsD**     |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **Best for**                  | Microservices, Kubernetes                          | IoT, serverless apps, logs           |
| **Data flow**                 | Monitoring system **pulls** from services          | Services **push** data to monitoring |
| **Examples**                  | Prometheus, Zabbix, Nagios                         | AWS CloudWatch, StatsD, Graphite     |
| **Reliability**               | More reliable (monitoring system controls polling) | Less reliable (risk of data loss)    |
| **Service Discovery Needed?** | ‚úÖ Yes                                             | ‚ùå No                                |

## üî• Hybrid Approach

Many organizations use a **combination of both** approaches:

- **Metrics (Pull-Based)** ‚Üí Prometheus scrapes system stats.
- **Logs (Push-Based)** ‚Üí Fluentd pushes logs to CloudWatch/Elasticsearch.
- **Traces (Push-Based)** ‚Üí Zipkin pushes traces to storage.
