# **LLD: Centralized Log Management & Automated Archival**

## **1. Problem Statement**

We need a **centralized log management system** to collect logs from multiple microservices, process them, and store them efficiently. The system should:

- Collect logs from **multiple microservices**.
- Use **Rolling File Appender** to manage log file sizes.
- Send logs to **Logstash**, which will process and forward them to **Elasticsearch**.
- Monitor **disk space usage** and send alerts if storage exceeds a threshold.
- Automatically archive old logs to **S3 Glacier** when disk space is low.

## **3. Components & Responsibilities**

### **(a) Microservices Logging (SLF4J, Log4J2, Rolling File Appender)**

Each microservice writes logs to files using **Rolling File Appender**. Example configuration:

```properties
appender.rolling.type = RollingFile
appender.rolling.name = RollingFileAppender
appender.rolling.fileName = logs/app.log
appender.rolling.filePattern = logs/archive/app-%d{yyyy-MM-dd-HH}.log.gz
appender.rolling.policies.time.type = TimeBasedTriggeringPolicy
appender.rolling.policies.time.interval = 1
appender.rolling.policies.size.type = SizeBasedTriggeringPolicy
appender.rolling.policies.size.size = 10MB
```

**Behavior:**

- Logs are saved to `logs/app.log`.
- Every hour (`%d{yyyy-MM-dd-HH}`), a new log file is created.
- Old logs are compressed (`.gz`) and moved to `logs/archive/`.
- If log file size exceeds `10MB`, a new file is created.

### **(b) Logstash Configuration (Sending Logs to Elasticsearch)**

Logstash processes log files and sends them to **Elasticsearch**.

```yaml
input {
file {
path => "/var/logs/app/*.log"
start_position => "beginning"
}
}
filter {
grok {
match => { "message" => "%{TIMESTAMP_ISO8601:timestamp} %{LOGLEVEL:level} %{GREEDYDATA:message}" }
}
}
output {
elasticsearch {
hosts => ["http://elasticsearch:9200"]
index => "logs-%{+YYYY.MM.dd}"
}
}
```

### **(c) Kibana (Log Analysis & Visualization)**

- **Kibana Dashboard** visualizes logs stored in Elasticsearch.
- Provides filtering, searching, and error tracking.

### **(d) Prometheus Monitoring & Alerting for Disk Space**

**Prometheus Configuration (Monitoring Disk Usage)**:

```yaml
- job_name: "node"
  static_configs:
    - targets: ["node-exporter:9100"]
```

**PromQL Query for Alerting**:

```promql
(node_filesystem_avail_bytes{mountpoint="/var/log"} / node_filesystem_size_bytes{mountpoint="/var/log"}) * 100 < 10
```

Triggers an **alert when disk usage is above 90%**.

### **(e) Alertmanager (Triggering Auto-Archival to S3 Glacier)**

- Alertmanager **sends alerts** to an automation script when disk usage is critical.
- **Automation Script** moves logs older than 30 days to **S3 Glacier**.

**Cron Job for Log Archival to S3 Glacier**:

```bash
0 3 * * * find /var/log/app/ -type f -mtime +30 -exec aws s3 mv {} s3://my-app-logs-archive/ --storage-class GLACIER \;
```

**Explanation:**

- Runs **daily at 3 AM**.
- Moves logs **older than 30 days** to **S3 Glacier**.

## **4. Interview Answering Guide**

**Q1: How do you manage large log volumes?**
✅ Use **Rolling File Appender** to limit log file size.
✅ Use **Logstash** to centralize logs in **Elasticsearch**.
✅ Store old logs in **S3 Glacier** to reduce disk usage.
✅ Monitor disk space with **Prometheus**.

**Q2: How do you automate log archival?**
✅ Use **cron jobs** or **Fluentd** to upload logs older than 30 days to **S3 Glacier**.
✅ Alerts from **Prometheus** trigger automatic archival.

**Q3: How do you monitor and alert on disk space?**
✅ **Prometheus** tracks disk usage.
✅ If space is **above 90%**, **Alertmanager** triggers an action.
✅ Automation moves logs to **cold storage**.

---

## **5. Summary**

🚀 **Microservices generate logs** → Rolling File Appender organizes them.
🚀 **Logstash sends logs to Elasticsearch** → Kibana provides search & visualization.
🚀 **Prometheus monitors disk usage** → Alertmanager triggers log archival.
🚀 **Old logs are moved to S3 Glacier** for cost savings.

This setup ensures **scalability, cost efficiency, and real-time monitoring** of logs. 🔥

//////////////////
Q - Is node exporter doing it getting the info?
Yes! Node Exporter is responsible for collecting infrastructure-level metrics like CPU, memory, disk usage, network stats, etc., from each node in a Kubernetes cluster.

For your log volume management LLD, Node Exporter will:
✅ Monitor disk space usage on nodes.
✅ Provide real-time disk utilization metrics to Prometheus.
✅ Enable Prometheus Alertmanager to send alerts if disk usage crosses a threshold (e.g., 80% full).

How It Works in Your LLD:
1️⃣ Microservices Write Logs → Using RollingFileAppender (Log4j/SLF4J).
2️⃣ Fluentd or Logstash Collect Logs → Send to Elasticsearch (for search) or S3 Glacier (for cold storage).
3️⃣ Node Exporter Collects Disk Metrics → Sends to Prometheus.
4️⃣ Prometheus Monitors & Triggers Alerts → If disk usage exceeds limits, triggers Alertmanager.
5️⃣ Alertmanager Notifies DevOps → Email, Slack, PagerDuty, etc.

# Log Volume Management LLD

## 1️⃣ Problem Statement

- Microservices generate large volumes of logs.
- Logs should be **rotated, archived, and moved** to cold storage when not needed.
- Prevent disk space from filling up by **monitoring & alerting** when usage is high.

## 2️⃣ Components

### **Log Collection & Storage**

1. **Microservices** → Generate logs using **RollingFileAppender (Log4j, SLF4J)**.
2. **Fluentd / Logstash** → Collect logs & send to a **centralized server** (e.g., Elasticsearch).
3. **Elasticsearch** → Index logs for **fast searching**.
4. **S3 Glacier (Cold Storage)** → Store old logs based on a **retention policy**.

### **Monitoring & Alerting**

5. **Node Exporter** → Collects **disk usage** metrics from Kubernetes nodes.
6. **Prometheus** → Scrapes metrics from Node Exporter.
7. **Alertmanager** → Triggers alerts if **disk usage exceeds threshold** (e.g., 80%).
8. **Notification System** → Sends alerts to **Slack, PagerDuty, Email**, etc.

## 3️⃣ Solution Flow

1️⃣ Microservices generate logs and store them in rolling log files.  
2️⃣ Logstash/Fluentd sends logs to **Elasticsearch** for indexing.  
3️⃣ Older logs are **archived to S3 Glacier** using an automated retention policy.  
4️⃣ **Node Exporter monitors disk usage** and reports to **Prometheus**.  
5️⃣ If **disk usage exceeds 80%**, **Alertmanager** triggers an alert.  
6️⃣ DevOps team gets notified via **Slack, PagerDuty, or Email**.

## 4️⃣ Technologies Used

✅ **Log Collection** → Log4j, SLF4J, Fluentd, Logstash  
✅ **Log Storage** → Elasticsearch, S3 Glacier  
✅ **Monitoring** → Prometheus, Node Exporter  
✅ **Alerting** → Alertmanager, Grafana  
✅ **Cold Storage** → AWS S3 Glacier (for long-term logs)

## 5️⃣ Example Prometheus Alert Rule

```yaml
- alert: HighDiskUsage
  expr: node_filesystem_avail_bytes / node_filesystem_size_bytes * 100 < 20
  for: 5m
  labels:
    severity: critical
  annotations:
    summary: "Disk space running low"
    description: "The disk usage is above 80%, needs cleanup."
```

Automation & Scaling
Lifecycle Policies: Automatically move logs from Elasticsearch → S3 Glacier.

Scheduled Cleanup Jobs: Delete logs older than X days from Elasticsearch.

Auto-scaling EKS nodes: If logs flood the system, scale nodes automatically.

✅ Summary
Logs are collected → Sent to Elasticsearch.

Old logs move to cold storage → S3 Glacier.

Disk usage is monitored → Node Exporter + Prometheus.

Alerts notify DevOps → If space is low, trigger cleanup or scale nodes.
