Q - but prometheus is deployed as apart of application in spring boot project how does it
connect to the kube state metrices how promethes look like in cofnig file

Ans -

When **Prometheus** is deployed as part of a **Spring Boot application**, the setup would typically involve **Prometheus** scraping metrics exposed by the Spring Boot application itself (via `/actuator/prometheus`) and, in a Kubernetes environment, also scraping **kube-state-metrics** for Kubernetes resource-level metrics. Here's how you can achieve this integration:

### **1. Prometheus in Spring Boot Application**

In a Spring Boot application, Prometheus can be integrated using the **Micrometer** library, which provides a Prometheus-compatible endpoint. This allows Prometheus to scrape application-level metrics.

#### Steps:

- **Add Micrometer Prometheus dependency** to the `pom.xml` of your Spring Boot application:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.micrometer</groupId>
    <artifactId>micrometer-registry-prometheus</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

- **Enable Prometheus metrics in the Spring Boot application**:
  Spring Boot exposes a `/actuator/prometheus` endpoint where metrics can be accessed. Ensure that the **Spring Boot Actuator** dependency is added to your `pom.xml` as well:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-actuator</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

- **Expose Prometheus metrics via the `/actuator/prometheus` endpoint** in `application.properties` or `application.yml`:

```yaml
management:
  endpoints:
    web:
      exposure:
        include: "prometheus"
  endpoint:
    prometheus:
      enabled: true
```

- Now, Prometheus can scrape the application metrics by hitting the `/actuator/prometheus` endpoint.

### **2. Prometheus Scraping Kubernetes Metrics (kube-state-metrics)**

In addition to scraping the application metrics from Spring Boot, Prometheus also needs to collect **Kubernetes resource-level metrics** (e.g., pod status, node metrics, deployment info, etc.) from **kube-state-metrics**.

To make this work, you'll need to configure Prometheus to scrape the **kube-state-metrics** endpoint, which exposes Kubernetes resource-level metrics.

#### Steps:

- **Deploy kube-state-metrics** in the Kubernetes cluster:

  kube-state-metrics is often deployed as a **Pod** in the `kube-system` namespace. You can install **kube-state-metrics** using Helm or manually through YAML manifests.

  Helm command to install kube-state-metrics:

  ```bash
  helm install kube-state-metrics prometheus-community/kube-state-metrics
  ```

  Alternatively, you can use the following YAML manifest to deploy it manually.

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: kube-state-metrics
  namespace: kube-system
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: kube-state-metrics
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: kube-state-metrics
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: kube-state-metrics
          image: quay.io/coreos/kube-state-metrics:v2.0.0
          ports:
            - containerPort: 8080
              name: http
```

- **Configure Prometheus to scrape kube-state-metrics**:
  Now, you need to configure Prometheus to scrape the metrics exposed by **kube-state-metrics**. This is done through **Prometheus scrape configurations** in the Prometheus configuration file (`prometheus.yml`).

#### Example of Prometheus `prometheus.yml` configuration to scrape **Spring Boot** and **kube-state-metrics**:

```yaml
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: "spring-boot-app"
    metrics_path: "/actuator/prometheus" # Spring Boot actuator endpoint
    static_configs:
      - targets: ["spring-boot-app-service:8080"] # Replace with your Spring Boot service name and port

  - job_name: "kubernetes"
    kubernetes_sd_configs:
      - role: pod
        namespaces:
          names:
            - kube-system
    relabel_configs:
      - source_labels: [__meta_kubernetes_pod_label_app]
        target_label: app
    metrics_path: "/metrics"
    honor_labels: true
    scheme: http

  - job_name: "kube-state-metrics"
    static_configs:
      - targets: ["kube-state-metrics.kube-system.svc.cluster.local:8080"] # Change to your kube-state-metrics service endpoint
    metrics_path: "/metrics"
```

#### Breakdown of the `prometheus.yml` configuration:

- **`spring-boot-app`**: This section tells Prometheus to scrape metrics from the Spring Boot application. It uses the **`/actuator/prometheus`** endpoint exposed by the Spring Boot app.
- **`kubernetes`**: Prometheus can also scrape general Kubernetes metrics, such as pod status, deployments, etc., from the Kubernetes API server.
- **`kube-state-metrics`**: Prometheus is set to scrape metrics exposed by **kube-state-metrics**, which provides Kubernetes resource-level metrics (e.g., pod status, number of replicas, node health, etc.).

### **3. Real-World Example: Monitoring with Prometheus in Spring Boot Application**

Hereâ€™s a simple, real-world use case scenario for using **Prometheus** with a **Spring Boot application** and **kube-state-metrics**:

1. **Spring Boot Application**:
   - Your Spring Boot application is deployed within a Kubernetes cluster.
   - The application exposes **application-level metrics** (e.g., request counts, response times, active threads) via the `/actuator/prometheus` endpoint.
2. **kube-state-metrics**:

   - Kubernetes itself is monitored through **kube-state-metrics**, which exposes metrics about Kubernetes resources (e.g., how many pods are running, whether deployments are up-to-date, etc.).
   - This is essential for understanding the health and performance of the Kubernetes resources, and can be used to trigger actions like Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA).

3. **Prometheus Scraping Metrics**:

   - Prometheus scrapes metrics from both the **Spring Boot application** (via `/actuator/prometheus`) and **kube-state-metrics** (via `/metrics`).
   - Prometheus aggregates and stores this data in its time-series database, where it can be analyzed and visualized.

4. **Alerting and Scaling**:
   - Based on the metrics, Prometheus can trigger alerts (e.g., if CPU usage exceeds 80% for a certain period) and can integrate with **Alertmanager**.
   - For autoscaling purposes, Kubernetes HPA can use Prometheus metrics to scale the number of pods in the application, depending on CPU or memory usage.

---

### **Conclusion**:

- **Prometheus** is deployed as a part of your **Spring Boot application** via the **Micrometer** library and exposed via `/actuator/prometheus`.
- **kube-state-metrics** is deployed within your Kubernetes cluster to expose metrics related to the state of Kubernetes resources.
- Prometheus is configured to scrape metrics from both your Spring Boot application and **kube-state-metrics** to get a comprehensive view of both application-level and infrastructure-level performance.
- Prometheus helps in monitoring, autoscaling (via HPA), and alerting in production environments, ensuring the system runs smoothly and can handle dynamic loads effectively.
