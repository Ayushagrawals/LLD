Yes, what I described earlier as **"Hash-Based Sharding"** can be extended to **Consistent Hashing**, which is a more advanced and **fault-tolerant** approach.

### **ðŸš€ How Consistent Hashing Works in Sharding?**  
**ðŸ’¡ Problem with Simple Hash-Based Sharding:**  
- If we use `hash(user_id) % N (shards)`, then **adding or removing a shard causes massive reshuffling** of data.  
- Example: If we go from **5 shards â†’ 6 shards**, almost all keys are reassigned, causing a **domino effect** (data must be redistributed).  

**âœ… Solution: Consistent Hashing**  
- Instead of `mod(N)`, **each shard is assigned to a point on a circular hash space (0-2^32)**.  
- Each **user_id or order_id is also hashed** and mapped to the nearest shard **clockwise**.  
- If a shard **fails**, its data is automatically distributed to the next available shard **without affecting others**.  
- If a **new shard is added**, it only takes part of the data instead of reshuffling everything.

### **ðŸŽ¯ Example: Handling Failover in Consistent Hashing**  

Imagine we have **3 shards** (**Shard A, B, C**) mapped on a **hash ring**:  
```
    0 ----> Shard A (0-120)
    |      
    | (User X â†’ Hash 105 â†’ Shard A)
    |
   120 ----> Shard B (120-240)
    |
    | (User Y â†’ Hash 200 â†’ Shard B)
    |
   240 ----> Shard C (240-360)
```

#### **ðŸ›‘ Scenario: What Happens If Shard B Fails?**  
- In traditional hashing (`mod N`), we would have to **recompute the hash for all users**, which is costly.  
- In **consistent hashing**, only users mapped to **Shard B** will get reassigned to **Shard C** (next clockwise shard).  
- No other shards are affected, **preventing a domino effect**.

### **ðŸ”¥ Why Use Consistent Hashing in Large-Scale Distributed Systems?**  
âœ… **Automatic Failover:** If a shard goes down, only its data moves to the next shard.  
âœ… **Minimal Data Movement:** Adding/removing shards **does not trigger global reshuffling**.  
âœ… **Load Balancing:** The system can distribute load dynamically as nodes join or leave.  
âœ… **Used in:** AWS DynamoDB, Apache Cassandra, and Distributed Caching Systems (e.g., Memcached, Redis Cluster).

### **ðŸ¤” How Would You Answer in an Interview?**  

**Question:**  
*"How do you design a scalable sharding strategy for an e-commerce platform? What if a shard fails?"*  

âœ… **Start with Simple Hash-Based Sharding**  
- *"Initially, we can use `hash(user_id) % N (shards)`, but this has a problem when we scale up/down."*  

âœ… **Then, Explain Consistent Hashing for Fault Tolerance**  
- *"To avoid massive data reshuffling, we use a **consistent hashing ring**. This ensures that only a small fraction of data moves when shards fail or scale up."*  

âœ… **Mention How Failover Happens**  
- *"When a shard fails, its users/orders are **automatically mapped to the next shard** on the ring, avoiding a system-wide failure."*  

âœ… **Bonus: Talk About Replication for Extra HA**  
- *"For high availability, each shard has a **replica** so that even if one shard fails, its data is still available."*
