### **Sharding in an E-Commerce Application**  

✅ **Sharding is used where high scalability & high availability are needed.**  
❌ **Sharding is avoided where strong consistency & ACID transactions are required.**

## **🔹 Where Will Sharding Be Used?**  

| **Service**          | **Use Sharding?** | **Why?** |
|----------------------|------------------|----------|
| **Order Service**    | ✅ Yes | Order volume is huge, needs scalability. Can be **sharded by User ID or Order ID**. |
| **Cart Service**     | ✅ Yes | Session-based, short-lived data. Sharded by **User ID** for faster retrieval. |
| **Product Catalog**  | ✅ Yes | Millions of products, sharded by **Category ID or Product ID**. |
| **Driver Service** (for delivery) | ✅ Yes | Large number of delivery agents, sharded by **Geographical Regions** (e.g., city/state). |
| **Ad Service**       | ✅ Yes | Ad impressions are high-scale, can be **sharded by Campaign ID**. |
| **User Service**     | ✅ Yes | Many users, sharded by **User ID** to balance load. |
| **Review Service**   | ✅ Yes | Large number of reviews, can be **sharded by Product ID**. |

## **🔻 Where Will Sharding NOT Be Used?**  

| **Service**            | **Use Sharding?** | **Why Not?** |
|------------------------|------------------|--------------|
| **Payment Service**    | ❌ No  | Payments need **strong consistency & ACID transactions**. RDBMS (MySQL/PostgreSQL) is better. |
| **Wallet/Balance Service** | ❌ No  | User balances require **ACID transactions**; should not be distributed. |
| **Inventory Service**  | ❌ No (or Limited)  | Stock count needs consistency, so it’s usually **replicated, not sharded**. |
| **Authentication Service (Auth & Tokens)** | ❌ No  | Authentication tokens are usually stored in a **distributed cache (Redis)** rather than a sharded database. |

## **🔹 How to Shard Different Services?**  

### **1️⃣ User-Based Sharding (Good for User-Specific Data)**  
- **Used in**: Orders, Cart, User Profiles  
- **How?**  
  - User IDs are evenly distributed across shards (e.g., Modulo Hashing → `UserID % N`).  
  - Ensures **all user-related data stays in the same shard**.  

### **2️⃣ Order ID-Based Sharding (Ensures Scalability)**  
- **Used in**: Order Service  
- **How?**  
  - Orders are **write-heavy**. Using Order ID as the sharding key ensures **fast writes**.  

### **3️⃣ Category/Product ID-Based Sharding (Good for Catalogs & Reviews)**  
- **Used in**: Product Catalog, Review Service  
- **How?**  
  - Products and reviews are **read-heavy**.  
  - Sharding by **Category ID or Product ID** keeps related data together.  

### **4️⃣ Geographical Sharding (Best for Location-Based Services)**  
- **Used in**: Driver Service, Delivery Tracking  
- **How?**  
  - Shard by **Region (e.g., City, State, Country)** to keep location-based data close.  

---

## **🚀 What Happens in Failure?**
- **Order Service:** If an Order Shard goes down → Use **replicated nodes** to recover.  
- **Driver Service:** If a Region-Based Shard fails → The nearest region takes over.  
- **Payment Service:** Uses **failover to another RDBMS instance**, not sharding.  

---

## **🔥 Conclusion**
- **Use Sharding for scalability:** Orders, Products, Cart, Drivers, Ads, Reviews.  
- **Use ACID-compliant DBs for consistency:** Payments, Balances, Authentication, Inventory.  
- **Use caching (Redis) for session-based data:** Authentication Tokens, Product Searches.

This setup ensures **scalability** for high-traffic services while keeping **critical services consistent**. 🚀
