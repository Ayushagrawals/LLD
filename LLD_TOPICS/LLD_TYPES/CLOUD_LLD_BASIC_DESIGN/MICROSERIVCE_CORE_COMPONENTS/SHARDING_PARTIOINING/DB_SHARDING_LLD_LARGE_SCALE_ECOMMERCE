### **LLD: Designing a Sharded Database for a Large-Scale E-Commerce System**  

📌 **Problem Statement:**  
You need to design a highly scalable database system for an e-commerce platform that handles millions of users and transactions. The system should support **high availability, fault tolerance, and efficient querying**.  

---

## **1️⃣ Key Considerations Before Sharding**  
✅ **Why sharding?**  
- A **single database instance** cannot handle millions of concurrent users efficiently.  
- **Read and write operations** will become slow as data grows.  
- Database locks will degrade performance during high-traffic events (e.g., Black Friday sales).  

✅ **Challenges to Address**  
- How to distribute data across shards?  
- How to maintain **consistency and transactions** across shards?  
- How to **query and join data efficiently**?  
- How to **handle failures and replication**?  

---

## **2️⃣ Sharding Strategies**  

**🔹 Option 1: Range-Based Sharding (Not Recommended for High-Traffic Use Cases)**  
📌 *Split database by user ID ranges (e.g., 1M users per shard)*  
🚫 Problem: Some shards will become hotspots (popular users may all land in one shard).  

**🔹 Option 2: Hash-Based Sharding (Recommended for Load Balancing)**  
📌 *Distribute data based on a **hashed shard key** (e.g., `hash(user_id) % number_of_shards`).*  
✅ **Pros:** Even distribution of traffic, prevents hotspots.  
✅ **Cons:** Harder to perform range queries (e.g., "Find all orders for last 7 days").  

**🔹 Option 3: Directory-Based Sharding (Flexible but Complex)**  
📌 *A lookup service maintains a mapping between users and shards.*  
✅ **Pros:** Shard location is flexible and can be changed dynamically.  
🚫 **Cons:** The lookup service can become a **single point of failure**.  

📢 **Best Strategy for E-Commerce:** **Hybrid Approach (Hash + Directory-Based Sharding)**  
- **User data**: Use **hash-based sharding** on `user_id` for even distribution.  
- **Order data**: Use **directory-based sharding**, mapping `order_id` to specific shards.  
- **Product catalog**: Store in a **NoSQL database** like DynamoDB for fast retrieval.

## **3️⃣ System Design Components**  

### **📍 Primary Database Architecture**  
| Table | Shard Key | Sharding Strategy |  
|--------|-----------|-------------------|  
| Users | `hash(user_id) % N` | Hash-Based |  
| Orders | `order_id` (stored in lookup table) | Directory-Based |  
| Inventory | `product_id` | Range-Based |  

### **📍 Query Routing (How Do We Access Shards?)**  
- Use an **API Gateway** that **routes queries** based on the shard key.  
- Implement a **shard-aware application layer** that knows where to send each query.  
- A **centralized metadata service** (e.g., Zookeeper) can maintain the **shard mapping** dynamically.  

### **📍 Handling Transactions Across Shards**  
Problem: Transactions span multiple shards (e.g., a user purchases items from different warehouses).  
✅ **Solution:** Use **SAGA Pattern** instead of 2PC (Two-Phase Commit).  
✅ Each step in the transaction is **compensatable** in case of failure.  

---

## **4️⃣ Replication & High Availability**  
✅ **Primary-Replica Architecture**  
- Each shard has **1 Primary Node** and **multiple Read Replicas**.  
- Writes go to the **Primary**, and reads are distributed across **Replicas**.  
- If a **Primary fails**, a **Replica is promoted** automatically (via AWS RDS Multi-AZ).  

✅ **Cold Storage for Old Orders**  
- Orders **older than 1 year** are moved to **AWS Glacier** for archival.  
- AWS Lambda triggers move old data **automatically** to reduce load on primary DB.  

✅ **Cache for Frequent Queries**  
- **Redis (ElastiCache)** caches frequent read queries (e.g., user profiles, product catalog).  
- **CDN (CloudFront)** caches product images to reduce DB and application load.  

---

## **5️⃣ Failure Handling & Disaster Recovery**  
🚨 **What happens if a shard fails?**  
✅ Replication ensures that **read queries** still work.  
✅ A **Failover Mechanism (AWS RDS Multi-AZ, Kubernetes StatefulSets)** ensures that a **new Primary** is elected.  
✅ A **backup strategy** (daily snapshot + WAL logs) helps recover lost data.  

---

## **6️⃣ Monitoring & Observability**  
✅ **AWS CloudWatch & Prometheus**: Monitor **database CPU, memory, and slow queries**.  
✅ **ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)**: Aggregates logs from all shards.  
✅ **Jaeger / OpenTelemetry**: Enables **Distributed Tracing** for cross-shard queries.
