Q -so only for internal service communication b/w microservice is it used(service discovery), but request coming from outside and api gatway doing like for /order routing to order-microservice so it agin go to the service discovery to load the data right? so this configuartion not only should be present in the microservice which one to call but also at the api gatway?
Yes, you're absolutely correct! When **requests** are coming from **outside** (i.e., from clients or external systems), the **API Gateway** typically acts as the entry point to your microservices ecosystem. The **API Gateway** is responsible for routing incoming requests to the appropriate microservice. Here's how it works and what needs to be configured:

### **How API Gateway Works in Microservice Communication:**

1. **External Requests**: An external request (e.g., a client calling `/order`) reaches the **API Gateway**.
2. **Routing to Internal Microservices**: The **API Gateway** uses routing logic to determine which internal microservice should handle the request. For example, if the URL is `/order`, the gateway will route the request to the **Order Microservice**.

3. **Service Discovery**: The **API Gateway** might need to call the **Service Registry** (e.g., **Eureka**) to look up the available instances of the **Order Microservice**. This is necessary to dynamically discover the instance of the **Order Microservice** that should handle the request, especially in environments where instances can be scaled dynamically (e.g., Kubernetes).

   - The **API Gateway** performs a service discovery query to get the available instances of the **Order Microservice**.
   - Then, it uses **Ribbon** (or another load balancing strategy) to route the request to one of the healthy instances of the **Order Microservice**.

### **Service Discovery at the API Gateway**:

- The **API Gateway** needs to have **Service Discovery** integrated so it can dynamically discover the microservices it routes requests to. This means that the API Gateway also needs to be **aware of the service names** registered in the Service Registry (Eureka, Consul, etc.) and be able to query it just like other microservices.

  - **Without Service Discovery**: The API Gateway would need static configuration for each microservice's IP/port, which can be very hard to maintain in a dynamic microservices environment (e.g., when services scale up/down or failover occurs).

  - **With Service Discovery**: The **API Gateway** dynamically queries the **Service Registry** (e.g., Eureka) for the list of available instances of the microservices it needs to route requests to. This allows the API Gateway to always find healthy instances of the microservices and dynamically adjust to changes in the environment (e.g., new instances being added, failed instances being removed).

### **API Gateway and Service Discovery Configuration**:

Yes, the **API Gateway** also needs configuration for **Service Discovery** (just like the microservices do). Here's how this would typically work:

- **API Gateway** (e.g., **Spring Cloud Gateway** or **Zuul**) will be set up with a **Service Discovery** client (e.g., **Eureka**).
- The API Gateway will use the **Service Discovery** to query the available instances of the target microservices (like **Order Microservice**).
- Once the **API Gateway** gets the list of available instances, it will use **Ribbon** (or another load balancer) to route requests to one of the healthy instances.

### **Example Flow:**

1. **External Request**: The client sends a request to the API Gateway: `GET /order/123`.
2. **API Gateway**:
   - The API Gateway routes this request to the **Order Microservice**.
   - The API Gateway queries **Eureka** to find all available instances of the **Order Microservice**.
3. **Service Discovery**:
   - **Eureka** responds with a list of available instances of the **Order Microservice** (e.g., `order-service-1`, `order-service-2`).
4. **Ribbon**:
   - The API Gateway uses **Ribbon** (or a similar client-side load balancer) to select a healthy instance (e.g., `order-service-1`).
5. **Request Handling**: The API Gateway sends the request to the selected instance (`order-service-1`), and the **Order Microservice** processes the request and sends back a response.
6. **Response**: The API Gateway returns the response back to the client.

### **Configuration Needed:**

For this to work, the **API Gateway** should be configured to interact with **Service Discovery** and use **Ribbon** for load balancing:

1. **API Gateway Configuration**:

   - **Service Registry Integration**: The API Gateway should be configured to register with the **Service Registry** (e.g., **Eureka**) so it can discover the target microservices dynamically.
   - **Routing Rules**: Define routing rules (e.g., `/order/**` routes to `order-service`), and ensure it queries the **Service Registry** for the right service instances.

   Example in **Spring Cloud Gateway**:

   ```properties
   spring.cloud.gateway.discovery.locator.enabled=true
   spring.cloud.gateway.discovery.client.service-id=order-service
   ```

2. **Service Discovery Configuration**: The API Gateway needs to know where the **Eureka Server** or **Service Registry** is located (e.g., Eureka server URL).

   Example configuration for Eureka in **Spring Cloud Gateway**:

   ```properties
   spring.application.name=api-gateway
   eureka.client.serviceUrl.defaultZone=http://localhost:8761/eureka/
   ```

3. **Ribbon Configuration**: The API Gateway can leverage **Ribbon** to perform load balancing. It automatically uses the Ribbon client when calling a service registered with the **Service Registry**.

### **In Summary:**

- The **API Gateway** will indeed interact with **Service Discovery** to route external requests to the appropriate microservices.
- It will query the **Service Registry** to discover available instances of the microservices.
- **Ribbon** in the API Gateway will handle the load balancing and ensure the request goes to a healthy instance.
- **Service Discovery** is not only necessary for internal microservice communication but also for routing requests from the **API Gateway** to the appropriate microservice.

This **configuration should be present in both the microservices and the API Gateway** to ensure proper communication and dynamic routing.
