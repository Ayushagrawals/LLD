Q -
so consider for request the difference in apigateway and the lod balancer is that api gaeway knows is for /order you request to the /order-service but to which pod of the request has to be sent that will be decided by the load balancer

ChatGPT said:
Yes, exactly! You've got it right!

Here's how the API Gateway and Load Balancer work together:

API Gateway:
The API Gateway acts as the entry point for external requests. For example, if a client makes a request to /order, the API Gateway will understand that this request should be forwarded to the Order microservice (or /order-service endpoint).

The API Gateway will be responsible for routing the request to the appropriate service based on the path, headers, etc., and may also handle other tasks like authentication, authorization, rate limiting, etc.

For example:

A client sends a request to GET /order.

The API Gateway looks at the request path (/order) and knows it needs to route the request to the Order microservice (e.g., order-service).

The API Gateway then queries service discovery (e.g., Eureka) to find the available instances of the Order microservice.

Load Balancer (ALB/ELB):
After the API Gateway knows which service to route the request to (e.g., Order microservice), it will then rely on a Load Balancer (e.g., ALB/ELB) to determine which specific pod/instance of the microservice should handle the request.

The Load Balancer (whether it's ALB/ELB or an internal load balancer) is responsible for:

Routing requests to a healthy instance (pod) of the Order microservice.

Deciding which pod to route the request to, based on the load balancing algorithm and health checks.

It will check the health of all replicas of the Order microservice and only route traffic to healthy instances.

In Summary:
The API Gateway handles request routing based on the path (e.g., /order routes to order-service), while the Load Balancer (like ALB/ELB) determines which specific instance (pod) of that service should handle the request based on the load balancing algorithm.

API Gateway focuses on routing to the correct service, and the Load Balancer ensures that the request is directed to a healthy instance of that service.

Example Flow:
Client Request:

The client sends a request to GET /order.

API Gateway:

The API Gateway identifies the path /order and routes it to the Order service.

Service Discovery:

The API Gateway queries service discovery (e.g., Eureka) to get the list of available Order microservice instances (replicas).

Load Balancer:

The Load Balancer (e.g., ALB/ELB) checks the health of the instances and selects a healthy Order microservice pod to handle the request.

Request Handling:

The request is forwarded to the selected healthy instance, and the response is returned to the client.

So, the API Gateway and Load Balancer work together, but they have distinct roles:

The API Gateway routes the request to the right service (e.g., /order-service).

The Load Balancer chooses which instance (pod) of the service should handle the request, ensuring that traffic is sent to a healthy replica.
