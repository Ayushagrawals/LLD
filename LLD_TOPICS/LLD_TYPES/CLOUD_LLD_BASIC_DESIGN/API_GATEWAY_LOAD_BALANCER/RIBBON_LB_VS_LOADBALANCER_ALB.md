# Microservices Load Balancing - ALB vs Ribbon

## Overview

In a microservices architecture, load balancing is essential to distribute traffic efficiently across various service instances. There are two main components involved in load balancing:

1. **Ribbon**: Client-side load balancer used for **internal communication** between microservices.
2. **ALB (Application Load Balancer) / ELB (Elastic Load Balancer)**: External load balancer used for **public-facing communication** to route requests from clients to microservices or API Gateway.

This document explains how **Ribbon** and **ALB** work together to ensure efficient load balancing both internally and externally in a microservices ecosystem.

## Key Differences Between ALB and Ribbon

### **ALB (External Load Balancer)** vs **Ribbon (Internal Load Balancer)**

| **Component**         | **ALB (External Load Balancer)**                                                                   | **Ribbon (Internal Load Balancer)**                                                                     |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Traffic Type**      | External (client requests)                                                                         | Internal (service-to-service communication)                                                             |
| **Scope**             | Routes requests to services from the outside world                                                 | Routes requests between services inside the microservices ecosystem                                     |
| **Load Balancing**    | Can route traffic based on health checks to the appropriate service instances                      | Routes to healthy instances of other services based on service discovery and load balancing algorithms  |
| **Service Discovery** | Not directly involved in service discovery; it routes to registered instances (through DNS or IPs) | Directly integrates with **Service Discovery** (e.g., **Eureka**) to discover healthy service instances |

## How ALB and Ribbon Work Together

### **1. Ribbon for Internal Service Communication**

- **Ribbon** is used for **internal load balancing** within microservices. When one microservice needs to communicate with another, Ribbon will:
  - Query the **Service Registry** (like **Eureka**) for a list of available instances.
  - Use load balancing algorithms (e.g., round-robin, random) to select a healthy instance of the target microservice.

### **2. ALB for Public Requests**

- **ALB** or **ELB** is used for **external-facing load balancing**, routing requests from **clients** (e.g., browsers or mobile apps) to the appropriate **microservice** or **API Gateway**.
- **ALB** performs **health checks** on the services and ensures that only healthy instances of a service (API Gateway or microservice) receive traffic.
- **ALB** does not manage internal routing or service discovery within the microservices ecosystem, which is handled by **Ribbon**.

---

## Example Flow

### **Public Request Flow (With ALB and API Gateway)**:

1. **External Request**: A client sends a request, e.g., `GET /order`.
2. **ALB**:
   - **ALB** routes the request to the **API Gateway** or directly to the **Order Microservice**.
   - It checks the health of the service instances and routes to a healthy one.
3. **API Gateway (Internal Load Balancing with Ribbon)**:
   - The **API Gateway** uses **Ribbon** to query **Service Discovery** (e.g., **Eureka**) for available instances of the **Payment Microservice**.
   - **Ribbon** applies load balancing and routes the request to a healthy instance of **Payment Microservice**.
4. **Response**: The **API Gateway** or the microservice sends the response back to the client.

### **Internal Service-to-Service Communication Flow (With Ribbon)**:

1. **Microservice A** needs to call **Microservice B**.
2. **Ribbon** in **Microservice A** queries **Service Discovery** (e.g., **Eureka**) for available instances of **Microservice B**.
3. **Ribbon** uses its load balancing algorithms to route the request to one of the healthy instances of **Microservice B**.
4. **Microservice B** processes the request and sends the response back to **Microservice A**.

## Do You Need Ribbon If You Have ALB/ELB?

- **Yes**, Ribbon is still needed for internal service-to-service communication, even if you have **ALB/ELB** for external traffic.
  - **ALB/ELB** handles external routing and health checks for services.
  - **Ribbon** handles internal routing between microservices using **Service Discovery** and load balancing.

## ALB vs Ribbon - Roles in a Microservices Ecosystem

| **Traffic Type**    | **ALB (External Load Balancer)**                                               | **Ribbon (Internal Load Balancer)**                                                 |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Role**            | Routes traffic from **clients** to microservices                               | Routes traffic **internally** between microservices                                 |
| **Health Checks**   | Performs **health checks** to ensure only healthy services receive traffic     | Doesn't handle health checks; relies on **Service Discovery**                       |
| **Load Balancing**  | Distributes traffic to **healthy** instances of services (e.g., via DNS or IP) | Uses **Service Discovery** to choose healthy instances based on internal algorithms |
| **Scope of Action** | Handles **external traffic** and service availability                          | Handles **internal communication** and load balancing between microservices         |

## Summary

- **ALB/ELB** handles **external load balancing** and **health checks** for incoming traffic from clients. It routes the requests to **healthy instances** of microservices or API Gateway.
- **Ribbon** manages **internal load balancing** and **service-to-service communication** within the microservices architecture. It dynamically discovers available instances through **Service Discovery** (e.g., **Eureka**) and routes requests to healthy instances based on the configured load balancing algorithm.

For **public-facing requests**, **ALB/ELB** handles the routing, and for **internal communication** between services, **Ribbon** ensures requests are sent to healthy service instances.

Q -so ribbon is deployed for each microservice and api gatway we already have one load balncer like alb which check for microservice status and send it

ChatGPT said:
You're absolutely right! Let's clarify the roles of Ribbon and the external load balancer (like ALB or ELB) in this setup:

Ribbon vs External Load Balancer (ALB/ELB)
Ribbon:

Ribbon is a client-side load balancer. It is deployed within each microservice (or API Gateway in the case of routing requests to other microservices).

It interacts with the Service Registry (e.g., Eureka) to dynamically discover available instances of services and applies load balancing strategies (e.g., round-robin, random, weighted).

Ribbon decides how to route requests to healthy instances of a microservice internally by querying the Service Registry.

External Load Balancer (ALB/ELB):

Application Load Balancer (ALB) or Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) is a reverse proxy that sits in front of your microservices (or API Gateway). It is used for external traffic routing.

ALB/ELB performs basic load balancing and health checks. It ensures that incoming requests are routed to a healthy instance of a service based on the health check status, which it continuously monitors.

The health checks are performed on the external endpoints of the microservices, ensuring only healthy instances receive traffic. If an instance is unhealthy (for example, if itâ€™s down or unresponsive), it will not receive traffic from the ALB/ELB.

How ALB and Ribbon Work Together:
External Requests:

When an external client sends a request, it first hits the API Gateway, which could be configured behind an ALB/ELB.

The ALB/ELB performs its own health checks and forwards the request to the API Gateway (or directly to the microservice if no API Gateway is used).

Internal Routing with Ribbon:

Once the request reaches the API Gateway (or directly to the microservice), Ribbon takes over internally to route the request to one of the healthy instances of the microservice.

Ribbon will query the Service Registry (e.g., Eureka) to get the list of available instances of the target microservice and apply load balancing strategies to route the request to the right instance.

Summary of Roles:
ALB/ELB: Manages external load balancing and health checks for incoming traffic. It ensures that only healthy instances of microservices or the API Gateway receive traffic. It operates at the infrastructure level, outside the microservices themselves.

Ribbon: Manages internal load balancing and routing inside your API Gateway or microservices. It interacts with the Service Registry to discover service instances and applies load balancing algorithms to route requests within the microservices architecture.

Configuration Flow:
External Request:

A client sends a request (e.g., /order) to the API Gateway through the ALB/ELB.

The ALB/ELB performs health checks on the API Gateway and routes the request to one of the healthy instances.

API Gateway (Ribbon):

The API Gateway (using Ribbon) queries Eureka or the Service Registry to discover available instances of the Order Microservice.

Ribbon applies load balancing (e.g., round-robin) and forwards the request to a healthy instance of the Order Microservice.

Microservice (Ribbon):

The Order Microservice might also use Ribbon internally to route requests to other services if needed (for example, calling a payment microservice, etc.).

Do You Need Ribbon in the Microservice If You Have ALB/ELB?
Yes, Ribbon is still useful inside the microservices and API Gateway even when you have an external load balancer like ALB/ELB.

ALB/ELB handles external routing and health checks.

Ribbon is used for internal service-to-service communication (e.g., when one microservice needs to call another microservice). It queries the Service Registry for available instances and balances the load between them.

When to Rely on ALB vs Ribbon:
ALB/ELB should be your first layer of defense for routing incoming external traffic to the appropriate service (API Gateway or microservice). It ensures only healthy services receive traffic based on health checks.

Ribbon (or client-side load balancers) should be used within your microservices (or API Gateway) to route requests to healthy instances of other services within the internal microservices ecosystem.

Final Architecture:
External Traffic hits the ALB/ELB, which routes the traffic to the API Gateway or directly to the microservice.

API Gateway (or microservice) uses Ribbon to query Service Registry for available instances of the target microservice.

Ribbon applies load balancing (round-robin, etc.) and forwards the request to a healthy instance of the target microservice.
