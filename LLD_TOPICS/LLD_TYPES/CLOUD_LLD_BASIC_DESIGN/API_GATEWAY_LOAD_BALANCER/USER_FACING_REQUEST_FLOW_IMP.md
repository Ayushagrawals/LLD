1. External Request Flow (Client → API Gateway → Load Balancer → Pod)
   This flow is for when a client (external user) makes a request to your API, which is routed via the API Gateway and Load Balancer to a microservice.

Flow Explanation:
Client Request:

A client (external user or service) sends a request to GET /order to your application.

API Gateway (Entry Point):

The API Gateway acts as the entry point for external requests.

It receives the request (GET /order) and identifies that it should route the request to the Order Service (e.g., order-service).

Service Discovery (Optional):

The API Gateway queries service discovery (e.g., Eureka) to discover available instances of the Order Service. It retrieves a list of available service instances (pods).

Load Balancer (ALB/ELB):

The API Gateway sends the request to an external load balancer (e.g., ALB/ELB) to ensure the request is routed to a healthy instance.

The Load Balancer checks the health of all available replicas (pods) of the Order Service.

It then applies load balancing algorithms (e.g., round-robin, least connections) to choose a healthy instance/pod to handle the request.

Healthy Pod (Microservice):

The Load Balancer routes the request to a healthy pod of the Order Service based on its internal health checks and the load balancing algorithm.

Response:

The Order Service processes the request and sends the response back to the API Gateway, which then returns it to the client.

This flow happens when Microservice A needs to call Microservice B internally within your application. The internal flow involves service discovery, Ribbon for client-side load balancing, and health checks.

Flow Explanation:
Microservice A Request:

Microservice A wants to call Microservice B (e.g., GET /order in the Order Service).

Service Discovery:

Microservice A queries service discovery (e.g., Eureka) to get a list of available instances (pods) of Microservice B (Order Service).

The service discovery returns a list of all instances of Microservice B (including both healthy and unhealthy ones).

Ribbon (Client-Side Load Balancer):

Ribbon is used within Microservice A to perform client-side load balancing. It decides which healthy instance of Microservice B to send the request to.

Ribbon checks the health status of the instances it has discovered (from the service registry).

It applies the load balancing algorithm (e.g., round-robin, random, weighted) and selects a healthy instance of Microservice B.

Microservice B:

Once Ribbon selects the healthy instance of Microservice B, it sends the request to that instance.

Microservice B processes the request and returns the response.

Response:

The response is sent back from Microservice B to Microservice A.
