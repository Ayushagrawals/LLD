Yes, you're absolutely right, and it's a great question! Let me explain how an **external load balancer** like **ALB** (Application Load Balancer) works, particularly in a **Kubernetes (EKS)** environment where **autoscaling** is involved.

### **How the External Load Balancer (ALB) Works in EKS**:

1. **EKS Cluster Setup**:

   - In a Kubernetes environment (like **EKS**), you typically run **pods** that serve your microservices. These pods are placed in **Kubernetes nodes** (EC2 instances in the case of EKS).
   - Kubernetes has **services** that expose your application (e.g., `order-service`, `payment-service`), and these services manage the communication between pods (replicas) of your microservices.

2. **ALB Ingress Controller**:

   - In EKS, to route external traffic to the right pods, you use an **ALB Ingress Controller**. This is a Kubernetes **Ingress Controller** that integrates with **AWS ALB** to manage routing of external requests.
   - The **ALB Ingress Controller** manages the lifecycle of **ALBs**, and it uses Kubernetes **Ingress resources** to map URLs and routing rules to the right service.

3. **Routing Traffic to Pods**:

   - The **ALB** doesn't have a direct mapping for every individual pod's IP address or port. Instead, it routes requests to **Kubernetes services**. These services act as a **stable endpoint** for the dynamic pods behind them.
   - The **Kubernetes Service** (e.g., `order-service`) is the **logical grouping** of pods (replicas) running your microservice, and it provides a **stable endpoint** (Cluster IP or LoadBalancer IP) to access those pods.
   - **ALB** routes incoming requests to the Kubernetes **service endpoint**, which in turn forwards the traffic to one of the available healthy pods behind that service.

4. **Autoscaling and Dynamic Updates**:

   - **Autoscaling** in Kubernetes can create or terminate pods dynamically based on load (using **Horizontal Pod Autoscaler** or **HPA**). As pods scale up or down, the **Kubernetes Service** automatically manages which pods are part of the service.
   - The **ALB Ingress Controller** listens for changes in the **Ingress resources** and dynamically updates the **ALB** with the appropriate backend configuration.
     - **When a new pod is added** or **a pod is removed**, Kubernetes updates the **service** and informs the **ALB Ingress Controller**.
     - **ALB** then uses the updated **service endpoints** to forward traffic to the appropriate pods.
     - **ALB** itself doesn't need to know the individual pod IP addresses, as it routes requests to the **service** IP, and the service will handle forwarding the request to a healthy pod.

5. **Health Checks**:
   - **ALB** performs regular **health checks** on the **service endpoint** (e.g., `/healthz` route) to determine whether the backend pods are healthy.
   - If a pod becomes unhealthy (e.g., crashes or doesn't respond to the health check), the **ALB** will stop routing traffic to that pod.
   - The **Kubernetes Service** ensures that only healthy pods are part of the **service** and can receive traffic from the **ALB**.

### **Summary of How ALB Handles Traffic**:

- **External traffic** comes into **ALB**.
- The **ALB Ingress Controller** in EKS routes traffic to the appropriate **Kubernetes service** based on URL path or other rules defined in the **Ingress resource**.
- The **Kubernetes service** acts as the stable endpoint and forwards the request to one of the available **healthy pods**.
- **Autoscaling** ensures that the number of pods adjusts automatically based on load, and the **ALB** continuously routes traffic to healthy instances of the service.
- The **ALB** doesn't directly map requests to individual pods, but it knows the **service** to route to, and the **Kubernetes service** handles the pod selection.

### **Diagram of the Process**:

```
External Request → ALB → ALB Ingress Controller → Kubernetes Service → Healthy Pods
```

In this process:

- **Kubernetes Service** ensures that only healthy pods are part of the routing pool.
- **ALB** routes traffic to the service, and **Kubernetes** takes care of the internal pod distribution.

### **ALB and Autoscaling**:

- As **pods scale up or down** based on load, **ALB** always routes traffic to the **service endpoint**.
- The **Kubernetes service** handles which pod will process the request based on health and availability.

### **How is this Different from Ribbon and Service Discovery for Internal Traffic**:

- **Ribbon** is a **client-side load balancer** used for **internal service-to-service communication**. It queries **service discovery** (e.g., **Eureka**) to get a list of **service instances** and then applies load balancing to route requests to a healthy instance.
- For **external traffic**, **ALB** and **Ingress Controller** are used to route traffic to services, while **Ribbon** and **Eureka** are **not involved** for external requests.

### **Key Takeaways**:

- For **external traffic**, **ALB** routes requests to **Kubernetes services**, not individual pods.
- **ALB** uses health checks to route traffic to healthy pods, and **autoscaling** ensures that the services scale up or down as needed.
- **Ribbon** is used for **internal communication** between microservices, while **ALB** handles **external communication**.
