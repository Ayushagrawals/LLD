Q - for internal service communication as we see that the load balancer ribbon is used so now are these service will come to picture or not for routing to the correct pod as load balancer is routing based on the algo so is kube service involved here

Great question! You're asking about **internal service communication** in a Kubernetes (EKS) environment where **Ribbon** is used for load balancing and **Kubernetes Services** are involved in routing traffic to the correct pods. Let's clarify the roles of **Kubernetes Services**, **Ribbon**, and **Load Balancers** for **internal communication**.

### **Internal Service Communication in Kubernetes with Ribbon**:

For **internal communication** between microservices, here's the breakdown of the flow and the roles of **Ribbon**, **Kubernetes Service**, and other components.

### **Key Components in Internal Communication**:

1. **Kubernetes Service**:

   - A **Kubernetes Service** is a logical abstraction that provides a stable **DNS** name for a set of **pods**.
   - It acts as the **entry point** for other services to communicate with a **set of pods** (e.g., `order-service`, `payment-service`).
   - **Kubernetes Service** automatically handles routing traffic to the appropriate pod, which is essential for managing dynamic pod IPs.
   - **Kubernetes Services** provide internal load balancing to distribute requests across the available healthy pods.

2. **Ribbon (Client-Side Load Balancer)**:

   - **Ribbon** is a **client-side load balancer** that is typically used when you need to manage **service discovery** and **load balancing** from the client side.
   - When **microservice A** (client) needs to communicate with **microservice B** (server), Ribbon helps by:
     - **Querying service discovery** (e.g., **Eureka** or **Kubernetes Service** if integrated with Kubernetes).
     - **Choosing a healthy instance** of **microservice B** based on the **load balancing algorithm** (e.g., round-robin, weighted response times).
   - Ribbon helps to ensure that **microservice A** doesn't have to hard-code IPs or addresses of **microservice B**. It will request a list of available healthy instances from **Eureka** or **Kubernetes Service**, and then use Ribbon to load balance the requests.

3. **Kubernetes Service's Role**:
   - **Kubernetes Service** (e.g., `order-service`) is responsible for managing traffic and routing requests to the **right pods**.
   - When **Ribbon** or any service internally calls the **Kubernetes Service** (via DNS, like `order-service.default.svc.cluster.local`), the **Kubernetes Service** routes the request to the appropriate pod(s), based on internal load balancing algorithms.

### **Flow of Internal Request (Service-to-Service)**:

1. **Microservice A** wants to call **Microservice B**.
2. **Ribbon** (in Microservice A) requests the available instances of **Microservice B** via **service discovery**:

   - If **Eureka** is used, **Ribbon** will query **Eureka** to get a list of **healthy instances** of **Microservice B**.
   - If you're using **Kubernetes Service**, **Ribbon** will simply use the **Kubernetes DNS** service name (e.g., `order-service.default.svc.cluster.local`) to resolve the list of available pods behind the **Kubernetes Service**.

3. **Ribbon** applies a load balancing algorithm (round-robin, random, etc.) to choose one of the **healthy pods** in **Microservice B**.

4. **Ribbon** routes the request to the selected pod's internal IP (which is provided by the **Kubernetes Service**).

5. **Kubernetes Service** ensures that the request is routed to the correct pod based on its internal load balancing.

6. **Microservice B** handles the request and returns the response.

### **Do Kubernetes Services Come Into Play?**

Yes, **Kubernetes Services** **are involved** in internal communication, but their role is slightly different compared to **Ribbon**:

- **Kubernetes Services** are responsible for **managing the available pods** for the service and providing a stable endpoint for other services to communicate with.
- **Ribbon** is a **client-side load balancer** that manages service discovery and load balancing at the client level (e.g., in **Microservice A**).
- **Kubernetes Services** handle the routing of traffic to the **healthy pods** based on the **DNS resolution**.

### **Roles of Ribbon and Kubernetes Service** in Internal Communication:

- **Kubernetes Service**:

  - **Manages the pods** and acts as a stable endpoint for the service.
  - Provides **internal load balancing** to distribute requests across healthy pods.
  - The **DNS name** of the service (e.g., `order-service.default.svc.cluster.local`) is used by other microservices to communicate with it.

- **Ribbon**:
  - **Manages service discovery** by querying **service discovery tools** (e.g., **Eureka** or **Kubernetes DNS**) to obtain the list of available instances (pods) of the service.
  - **Load balances** the requests from the client side by selecting one of the available pods based on a configured algorithm (e.g., round-robin, weighted).

### **Example Scenario** (Microservice A â†’ Microservice B):

1. **Microservice A** wants to call **Microservice B**.
2. **Microservice A** uses **Ribbon** to query **Eureka** or **Kubernetes Service** to get the list of available instances of **Microservice B**.
3. **Ribbon** picks one of the healthy instances and sends the request to the chosen pod's internal IP (e.g., `order-service-123-abc.default.svc.cluster.local`).
4. The **Kubernetes Service** routes the request to the correct pod.
5. **Microservice B** processes the request and returns the response.

### **Summary of Involved Components**:

- **Kubernetes Service** provides a stable DNS and routes traffic to healthy pods.
- **Ribbon** is used by **Microservice A** (the client) to discover healthy instances of **Microservice B** and apply load balancing.
- **Kubernetes Service** ensures traffic is routed to healthy pods when Ribbon decides which instance to call.

### **Conclusion**:

- In **internal service communication**, **Kubernetes Service** ensures the request reaches a healthy pod.
- **Ribbon** handles **service discovery** and **load balancing** for the **client-side** (Microservice A), making it possible to route traffic intelligently.

To answer your question: Yes, **Kubernetes Service** is involved in routing the request, but **Ribbon** manages the client-side load balancing, choosing the right instance from the available **pods**. **Kubernetes Service** ensures the request reaches the correct pod and handles the dynamic nature of pod scaling and health.
