Internal Request Flow (Microservice A → Service Discovery → Ribbon → Microservice B)
This flow happens when Microservice A needs to call Microservice B internally within your application. The internal flow involves service discovery, Ribbon for client-side load balancing, and health checks.

Flow Explanation:
Microservice A Request:

Microservice A wants to call Microservice B (e.g., GET /order in the Order Service).

Service Discovery:

Microservice A queries service discovery (e.g., Eureka) to get a list of available instances (pods) of Microservice B (Order Service).

The service discovery returns a list of all instances of Microservice B (including both healthy and unhealthy ones).

Ribbon (Client-Side Load Balancer):

Ribbon is used within Microservice A to perform client-side load balancing. It decides which healthy instance of Microservice B to send the request to.

Ribbon checks the health status of the instances it has discovered (from the service registry).

It applies the load balancing algorithm (e.g., round-robin, random, weighted) and selects a healthy instance of Microservice B.

Microservice B:

Once Ribbon selects the healthy instance of Microservice B, it sends the request to that instance.

Microservice B processes the request and returns the response.

Response:

The response is sent back from Microservice B to Microservice A.

Key Differences Between External and Internal Request Flows:
External Request Flow:

Requests come from external clients.

The API Gateway routes the request to the correct microservice.

An external load balancer (ALB/ELB) routes the request to a healthy pod.

Internal Request Flow:

Requests come from one microservice (A) to another microservice (B) within the same system.

Service discovery is used to find available instances of Microservice B.

Ribbon performs client-side load balancing and ensures the request is routed to a healthy pod of Microservice B.

These flows highlight how external traffic and internal communication are handled differently but follow similar principles of load balancing and health checks to ensure traffic is routed to healthy instances.
