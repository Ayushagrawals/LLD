For any board game we can consider it as a foundation anthing in which user interacting with
each other for example chatting so we have chat id which will foreign key to the
pariticpant.\
here we have participant table and the game table game id will be a foreign key

This concept can be added to the ludo, chess and any other board game of 0 X
the games stragey and the classes like board and the cell is going to be changed.

This can be a strgey pattern where game class and user and the participant is the 
reusbale and board interface and cell interface will be implemented like 


public interface Board {
    void initializeBoard();
    void printBoard();
}


public class TicTacToeBoard implements Board {
    private String boardId;       // Unique identifier (optional, useful in DB)
    private int size = 3;
    private Cell[][] cells;

    @Override
    public void initializeBoard() {
        cells = new Cell[size][size];
        for (int i = 0; i < size; i++)
            for (int j = 0; j < size; j++)
                cells[i][j] = new Cell(i, j);
    }

    @Override
    public void printBoard() {
        // Show board contents
    }
}
